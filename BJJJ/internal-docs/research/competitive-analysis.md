# BJJ Progress Tracker - Competitive Analysis

**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

The BJJ training tracker market is fragmented with several small independent apps, no clear market leader, and significant gaps in features. Most competitors rely on manual data entry, lack coach-practitioner connectivity, and have limited gym management capabilities. This presents a strong opportunity for differentiation.
