# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu belt curriculum: From white belt survival to black belt mastery

**BJJ's progression from white to black belt spans approximately 10-15 years and transforms practitioners from survival-focused beginners into complete martial artists.** The journey involves mastering hundreds of techniques across distinct positional categories, developing chain attacks and systems, and eventually contributing to the art through teaching and innovation. Each belt represents not just technical proficiency but a fundamental shift in how practitioners understand movement, leverage, and problem-solving on the mat.

The curriculum divides into three interconnected pillars: sport jiu-jitsu techniques for competition, self-defense skills for real-world application, and conceptual understanding that enables adaptation beyond memorized techniques. Major academies like Gracie University, Gracie Barra, Alliance, and 10th Planet each emphasize different elements, yet share common technical foundations.

## Guard systems form the foundation of bottom game development

The closed guard remains the first guard every practitioner learns, functioning as both offensive and defensive platform. White belts master fundamental sweeps including the **scissor sweep** (grip collar and sleeve, chop top leg down while bottom leg sweeps), **hip bump sweep** (explosive sit-up when opponent postures), and **flower/pendulum sweep** (same-side sleeve and pants grip with explosive leg motion). Core submissions from closed guard include the armbar, triangle choke, kimura, and guillotine.

Half guard introduces the critical concept of the underhook battle. The position offers several variations based on defensive structure:

| Variation | Belt Level | Primary Use |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Basic half guard | White | Fundamental recovery position |
| Knee shield (Z-guard) | Blue | Frame creation across opponent's torso |
| Lockdown | Blue | 10th Planet system; control through leg entanglement |
| Deep half | Purple | Complete body positioning under opponent |

The **old school sweep** represents the fundamental half guard attack, using the underhook to drive forward and tilt the opponent. More advanced options include the **plan B sweep** when the opponent applies a whizzer, and the **electric chair sweep** from lockdown position.

Open guards expand dramatically at blue and purple belt levels. **De La Riva guard**, developed by Ricardo De La Riva in the 1980s, hooks the opponent's lead leg from outside while maintaining collar and ankle control. This position enables berimbolo attacks for back takes and transitions to X-guard. **Spider guard** uses both feet on the opponent's biceps with sleeve grips, creating constant tension that opens triangle and omoplata attacks. **Butterfly guard**, made famous by Marcelo Garcia, relies on strong hooks inside the opponent's thighs combined with upper body control to execute hook sweeps and arm drags.

X-guard and Single Leg X (ashi garami) positions have become essential for modern leg lock systems. Both positions control one opponent leg with two attacking legs—X-guard hooks behind the knee while pushing the hip, while Single Leg X serves as the primary entry point for straight ankle locks, toe holds, and heel hooks.

Guard retention principles apply across all guards: maintain frames using arms and shins to prevent chest-to-chest contact, keep four points of contact with the opponent at all times, and hide the hip-to-armpit gap that passers exploit.

## Top game positions demand submission chains and pressure control

Mount represents the most dominant upper-body control position. Variations progress from low mount (stable base, fewer attacks) through high mount (knees near armpits, more submissions) to S-mount (one knee beside opponent's head, devastating armbar setups). Maintenance requires grapevines around the opponent's legs to limit bridging, and constant hip adjustment to ride escapes.

Submissions chain together based on defensive reactions:

- **Americana** when opponent's arm is trapped with forearm pointing up
- **Armbar** when opponent pushes upward (step over head, hip extension finish)
- **Ezekiel choke** from grapevine control (works in both gi and no-gi)
- **Arm triangle** when opponent puts one arm in and one out (compress shoulder into carotid)

Side control variations include standard perpendicular chest-to-chest, **100 kilos** (heavy hip pressure with sprawled legs), and **kesa gatame** (scarf hold with trapped arm). The **triple threat attack series** from arm trap position flows between Americana, straight armbar, and kimura based on how the opponent straightens or rotates the arm.

Knee on belly serves as a transition position worth two points in IBJJF competition when held three seconds. The knee drives into the sternum with weight pressing downward while one foot posts for base. Attacks include near-side and far-side armbars (pivoting over the opponent's face when they push), baseball bat choke (maintaining grip through transition to north-south), and D'arce choke when the opponent pushes the midsection.

Back control provides the highest submission success rate in competition. The **seatbelt grip** places the choking arm over the shoulder and support arm under the opposite armpit, hands connected to protect the attacking hand. **Hooks in** positions both feet inside the opponent's thighs—never cross ankles due to ankle lock vulnerability. **Body triangle** wraps one leg across the opponent's waist and locks in a triangle, providing superior control that restricts all movement.

The rear naked choke sequence begins from seatbelt by feeding the top arm deeper across the chest to grab the opposite shoulder. When the opponent defends, hooking their arm with your leg creates the arm trap that enables sliding the choking arm to the neck.

## Guard passing requires systematic approaches for each guard type

The passing game divides into pressure-based and speed-based methods, with practitioners typically developing proficiency in both systems.

**Pressure passing** techniques include:

- **Body lock pass**: Wrap arms around opponent's torso with double underhooks, tripod up on feet and head, work past half guard to mount or side control
- **Over-under pass**: One arm under opponent's leg near hip, one over opposite leg, shoulders controlling hips
- **Stack pass**: Both arms under opponent's legs, stack hips above shoulders, walk around to side control
- **Smash pass**: Use chest weight to collapse opponent's legs together before passing

**Speed passing** techniques include:

- **Toreando (bullfighter)**: Control inside of knees, redirect legs while sprawling hips back, hop around to side control
- **Leg drag**: Redirect opponent's leg across their centerline, maintain ankle control while passing
- **X-pass**: Move your body out of the way rather than manipulating opponent's body
- **Long step**: Large step around opponent's guard from headquarters position

The **knee slice pass** remains the highest-percentage fundamental pass across all levels. From combat base (one knee up, one down), position the forward knee on the opponent's thigh, establish an underhook on the passing side, then slide the knee across while controlling head and arm. Success rates increase from approximately 45% at beginner level to 75% at advanced levels.

**Headquarters position** has emerged as a critical modern passing stance. The passer positions on top of the opponent's shin with their leg trapped between the passer's legs, bypassing the feet (first line of defense) and neutralizing modern guards like De La Riva, lasso, and spider. From headquarters, the passer attacks knee slice left, smash pass right, or X-pass center.

| Situation | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Legs elevated high | Speed passing (toreando, leg drag) |
| Legs at mid-level | Either style / Headquarters |
| Legs positioned low | Pressure passing (body lock, stack) |
| Athletic opponents | Pressure passing wears them down |
| Flexible guard players | Pressure neutralizes flexibility |
| Running low on time | Speed passing for quick advancement |

## Takedowns blend wrestling, judo, and clinch techniques for BJJ application

Wrestling takedowns center on the single leg and double leg. The **high single** grabs behind the opponent's knee with head positioned inside (reducing guillotine risk), finishes through quarter turns, lifts, or running the pipe. The **blast double** uses explosive penetration between the legs, wrapping both legs behind knees while driving at a 45-degree angle with the head tight to the opponent's side.

The **arm drag** creates angles by pulling the opponent's arm across their body, opening back takes, single legs, inside trips, and go-behinds.

Judo throws divide into foot techniques (ashi-waza), hand techniques (te-waza), and hip techniques (koshi-waza):

| Throw | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Osoto gari** | Foot | Break balance to rear corner, reap outside leg |
| **Ouchi gari** | Foot | Attack inside of far leg, works with push/pull motion |
| **Seoi nage** | Hand | Shoulder throw; grip lapel, turn 180°, throw over shoulder |
| **Harai goshi** | Hip | Load opponent on hip, sweep far leg with rotating motion |
| **Uchi mata** | Hip | Sweep between legs against inner thigh (highest-scoring judo throw) |

The clinch provides the transition point between standing and ground work. **Underhooks** (arm under opponent's arm holding midsection) enable takedowns, throws, and trips. **Double underhooks** with gable grip behind the back represents the most dominant clinch position. **Body lock takedowns** wrap arms around the opponent's torso and finish through angling, breaking posture, and twisting to trip.

**Guard pulling** has become essential for sport competition. Proper technique establishes strong grips (sleeve/collar in gi, 2-on-1 in no-gi), places a foot on the opponent's hip on the same side as the elbow grip, then sits back while pulling the opponent into guard. IBJJF requires at least one grip before pulling, and ADCC penalizes guard pulls.

## Gracie Combatives defines the self-defense curriculum

The Gracie Combatives program encompasses **36 essential techniques** organized into 23 one-hour lessons, originally developed for the U.S. Army. The curriculum addresses the four positions most common in real confrontations: Mount, Guard, Side Mount, and Standing.

**Standing self-defense techniques** include:

- **Clinch establishment** against aggressive and conservative opponents (closing distance eliminates striking power)
- **Haymaker punch defense** (slip underneath, get behind opponent, establish rear clinch)
- **Headlock escapes** for both standing and ground situations
- **Guillotine choke** when tackled or shot upon
- **Standing armbar** as counter to chest pushing

**Ground self-defense** centers on the **Punch Block Series**, a five-stage system for neutralizing strikes from guard:

1. **Stage 1**: Opponent in guard not actively striking—control posture
2. **Stage 2**: Opponent posturing up—maintain wrist/sleeve control
3. **Stage 3**: Opponent throwing punches—block and redirect
4. **Stage 4**: Opponent leaning forward—sweep opportunities
5. **Stage 5**: Opponent standing in guard—leg control, stand-up, or sweep

The **trap and roll** (upa) from mount and **elbow escape** (shrimp) represent the primary escape methods against ground-and-pound. Both techniques emphasize protecting the face with frames while executing the escape to recover closed guard, which neutralizes further striking.

Completion of Gracie Combatives requires attending each lesson three times, completing 12 Reflex Development classes, and passing a 25-minute evaluation with 90% minimum score. This earns the Combatives Belt (white belt with navy blue center), an intermediary rank before advancing to the Master Cycle program.

## Leg lock curriculum follows strict belt-level progressions

IBJJF rules define which leg attacks are legal at each belt level in competition:

| Belt Level | Gi Legal | No-Gi Legal |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| White/Blue/Purple | Straight ankle lock only (turn away from knee) | Same |
| Brown/Black | Ankle lock, toe hold, kneebar, calf slicer | ALL including heel hooks (2021 change) |

The **straight ankle lock** (Achilles lock) remains the only legal lower body submission for white through purple belts. Proper application turns away from the attacked knee; turning toward the knee is illegal due to reaping concerns.

**Ashi garami positions** (leg entanglements) categorize based on trapped leg placement:

**Category A (trapped leg outside body)**:
- **Standard ashi garami** (Single Leg X): Outside foot on hip, inside leg hooks thigh—primary position for straight ankle locks
- **Outside ashi garami**: Inside leg crosses to outside of opponent's hips, ankles crossed—excellent heel hook control
- **Cross ashi garami**: Both legs hook inside opponent's opposite thigh

**Category B (trapped leg inside—Saddle/411)**:
- **Inside sankaku** (Saddle/Honey Hole/4-11): Front leg laced over opponent's leg, back leg behind thigh, triangled configuration—primary position for inside heel hooks
- **Lateral kneebar position**: Derived from saddle, optimal for kneebar attacks

**Category C (50/50 variations)**:
- **50/50 guard**: Both practitioners have inside legs laced together—equal attack/defense (leg lock shootout)
- **80/20 and 90/10 positions**: Improved control variations with better attacking angles

**Heel hook mechanics** differ between inside and outside attacks. Inside heel hooks target the ACL (more dangerous, damage before pain) with the heel rotating inward toward the opponent's body from saddle position. Outside heel hooks target lateral knee ligaments (MCL, LCL) with the heel rotating outward from standard ashi positions.

Defense prioritizes the **boot** (point toes toward own body, straighten leg to flex ankle) combined with **clearing the knee line** (if your knee is past their knees toward their head, you're in danger). Hip elevation reduces opponent control since leg locks work best when both hips are grounded.

The modern consensus recommends all practitioners learn leg lock concepts for defensive awareness regardless of belt level, with submission applications following IBJJF competition progression.

## Major academy curricula emphasize different technical philosophies

**Gracie University** (Rener and Ryron Gracie) maintains the strongest self-defense orientation. The Master Cycle program beyond Combatives organizes techniques into seven chapters: Mount, Side Mount, Guard, Half Guard, Back Mount, Leg Locks, and Standing. Blue belt testing includes both gi and no-gi sparring plus five-minute "fight simulation sparring" with strikes.

**Gracie Barra** (Carlos Gracie Jr.) uses a three-tier structure: GB1 Fundamentals (16-week curriculum cycle, 96 technique videos), GB2 Advanced (requires 3 stripes on white belt, introduces no-gi and live sparring), and GB3 Black Belt (blue belt prerequisite, competition preparation focus).

**Alliance BJJ** organizes curriculum into modules by belt level with an emphasis on competition success—the system has produced six World Team Championships and over 50 individual black belt world titles. Promotions follow both instructor discretion and IBJJF time-in-grade requirements.

**10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu** (Eddie Bravo) trains exclusively no-gi with MMA applicability. The system emphasizes four signature elements: **Rubber Guard** (high flexible closed guard using leg across opponent's shoulder/neck), **Lockdown** (half-guard leg entanglement control), **The Truck** (alternate back control for Twister setup), and comprehensive leg locks. The warmup series A through H comprises four flows each, covering attacking and defending from specific positions.

**Roy Dean** takes a conceptual approach rather than exhaustive technique syllabus. Blue belt requirements cover 77 techniques across fundamentals. His core insight differentiates belt levels: "At Blue Belt you learned WORDS, at Purple Belt you start making SENTENCES"—emphasizing multi-technique combinations over isolated techniques.

**Pedro Sauer BJJ Association** maintains one of the most structured curricula with specific technique counts: Blue to Purple requires 85 updated techniques (2025 curriculum), Purple to Brown requires 59 techniques, and the Black Belt test covers 72 techniques representing the total self-defense curriculum from Helio Gracie enhanced by Pedro Sauer's contributions.

## Escape techniques require hierarchical defensive priorities

Mount escapes represent the first survival skills every practitioner learns. The **trap and roll** (upa/bridge and roll) traps the opponent's arm and foot on the same side, then bridges explosively to reverse position. The **elbow-knee escape** (shrimp) frames on the hip, bridges slightly, shrimps out, inserts the knee, and recovers half or full guard. The **heel drag** uses the foot to drag the opponent's heel while shrimping to create space.

Side control escapes combine frames with hip movement. The fundamental **elbow-knee escape** frames at hip and neck, shrimps to insert the knee, and recovers guard. The **ghost escape** uses the opponent's pressure against them—frame at neck, shrimp out, spin underneath. **Wrestling up** posts on the hand while framing the elbow against the neck to sit up to knees.

Back control escapes prioritize hand fighting before addressing hooks. The **baseball bat escape** grabs the "over" arm wrist with both hands, pushes the arm to the opposite side, then clears hooks. The critical principle: escape to the weak side (underhook side) when possible, falling with head to floor while turning hips parallel to ground.

Knee on belly escapes must avoid arm isolation traps—never push the knee with the far arm (armbar risk) or push the torso with the near arm (also armbar risk). The primary escape wedges the elbow between bodies, hip escapes, and recovers guard.

Turtle escapes include the **sit-out** (post on mat, swing leg underneath opponent's torso), **granby roll** (shoulder roll inverting to recover guard), and **technical stand-up** (stand while controlling opponent's arm/wrist). The "turtle cheat code" involves controlling the opponent's top arm with baseball bat grip while positioning the top of the head against the inside of their armpit.

## Conceptual principles underpin all technical development

**Frames** create shields using the skeletal system—forearms, shins, and knees form barriers preventing the opponent from closing in. Effective frames rely on bone alignment rather than muscle strength, with elbows and knees kept close to the body for maximum structural integrity.

**Levers** provide force multiplication for attacks. The three-joint rule applies to both arms (shoulder, elbow, wrist) and legs (hip, knee, ankle)—controlling at least two of three joints enables effective submission attacks. Body lever hierarchy from strongest to weakest: legs → arms → head. All legitimate submissions attack one or more levers.

**Wedges** block and restrict opponent movement. Blocking wedges immobilize body parts (hand beside hip preventing re-guarding), while prying wedges force open defensive structures (knee cutting through guard).

**Posture and base** create the foundation for all techniques. When an opponent's center of gravity moves beyond their base of support, they will fall—this principle drives all sweeps and takedowns. Attacking the head as a lever primarily attacks posture; attacking arms and legs primarily attacks structure.

**Positional hierarchy** (from most dominant to most vulnerable): Back control → Mount → Knee on belly → Side control → Half guard top → Guard positions → Side control bottom → Mount bottom → Back taken. The core strategic principle: **position before submission**—achieve dominant position before attempting to finish.

**Chain attacks** define advanced play. Classic sequences include armbar → triangle → omoplata from closed guard, hip bump sweep → kimura → guillotine from guard, and cross choke → armbar from mount. Each technique in the chain sets up the next based on the opponent's defensive reactions.

## Belt progression reflects developmental stages beyond technique counts

**White belt** (1-2 years typical) focuses on survival, learning approximately 30-40 fundamental techniques while developing a frame of reference for future learning. Priority skills include relaxation under pressure, controlling ego, learning position names and feels, and mastering basic movements (shrimping, bridging, technical stand-up).

**Blue belt** (2+ years at rank before purple) requires defense proficiency: at least two solid escapes from mount, back mount, and side control, plus two techniques for passing guard. Blue belts should have at least one viable technique from all major positions and understand both sport and self-defense applications. Roger Gracie emphasized that he "first made it almost impossible for anybody to tap me out" before focusing on offensive development.

**Purple belt** (18+ months before brown) represents the gateway to advanced play. Key development areas include three combination attacks from guard, three submissions from side mount/mount/back mount, and familiarity with all guard variants while specializing in at least one or two. Purple belts typically begin teaching fundamentals classes and know "all the techniques a black belt does—it is the experience that makes the difference."

**Brown belt** (12+ months before black) demands a complete game with signature techniques that work on almost everybody. Very few positions or situations should be unfamiliar. Brown belts often serve as the bridge between beginners and professors, teaching regularly while eliminating remaining weak points in their game.

**Black belt** (minimum age 19, typically 8-15 years total training) signifies true mastery—economy of motion, knowing when to move and when not to move, and technique that "looks good." The black belt's game is built on refined fundamentals rather than flash. Beyond technical proficiency, black belts carry responsibility for teaching, mentorship, and contributing to the art's development.

IBJJF degree progression after black belt spans decades: 1st through 3rd degrees require 3 years each, 4th through 6th degrees require 5 years each, 7th and 8th degrees (coral belts) require 7 years each, and 9th degree (red belt) requires 10 additional years with minimum age approximately 67.

## Conclusion

BJJ curriculum represents an integrated system where every technique connects to broader positional and mechanical principles. The progression from survival-focused white belt to teaching-oriented black belt follows predictable developmental stages: fundamental escapes and submissions, expanded positional awareness, chain attacks and systems development, game refinement and counter-based strategy, and finally complete mastery with contribution to the art.

The most significant insight across all curricula is that technique quantity matters less than technique integration. Purple belts learning to chain attacks into "sentences" from the "words" they memorized as blue belts exemplifies this shift. The universal principles—frames for defense, levers for offense, position before submission, and chain attacks over isolated techniques—remain consistent across Gracie University's self-defense emphasis, Gracie Barra's structured approach, Alliance's competition focus, and 10th Planet's no-gi innovation.

Modern leg lock development has added an entirely new dimension to the curriculum, with the 2021 IBJJF rule changes legalizing heel hooks for brown and black belt no-gi competition. This has accelerated leg entanglement education across all belt levels for defensive purposes, even where submissions remain competition-illegal. The Danaher Death Squad systematization of ashi garami positions has become required knowledge for serious practitioners regardless of affiliation.
