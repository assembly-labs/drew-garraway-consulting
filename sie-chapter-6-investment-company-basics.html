                Before 1924, if you wanted a diversified portfolio of stocks, you needed to be wealthy. Really wealthy. The kind of wealthy where you could afford to buy meaningful positions in dozens of companies while still having enough left over for a reasonable life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then something remarkable happened in Boston. The Massachusetts Investors Trust launched on March 21, 1924, becoming what most consider America's first modern mutual fund. The concept was elegantly simple: pool money from many investors, hire a professional to manage it, and suddenly the average person could own a slice of corporate America.

            <h2>What is an Investment Company?</h2>

            <p>
                An investment company does exactly what the name suggests: it's a company that invests. More specifically, it:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Issues securities to raise capital from investors</li>
                <li>Uses those proceeds to build a portfolio of securities</li>
                <li>Allows investors to own shares of that diversified pool</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Think of it as crowdfunding for Wall Street, except it predates that term by about 90 years.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="act-1940">
            <h2>The Investment Company Act of 1940</h2>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>
                    After the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, Congress decided that maybe—just maybe—some regulation of pooled investment vehicles would be prudent. The Investment Company Act of 1940 established the framework we still use today. The 1929 crash exposed serious problems with pooled investments of the era. Many were highly leveraged, charged excessive fees, and lacked transparency.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>The Act recognizes three types of investment companies:</p>

            <pre>
                    Types of Investment Companies
                               |
          ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
          |                    |                    |
   Face-Amount         Management Company      Unit Investment
    Certificate                |                Trust (UIT)
     Company                   |                    |
                        ┌──────┴──────┐        ┌────┴────┐
                        |             |        |         |
                    Open-End    Closed-End   Fixed    Non-Fixed
                        |             |       UIT        UIT
                        |             |        |         |
                    Mutual Fund  Publicly   Fixed    Variable
                                 Traded    Trust     Annuity
                                  Fund
            </pre>

            <p>
                <strong>Face-Amount Certificate Companies</strong> are largely historical relics—they promised to pay a fixed sum at maturity if you made periodic payments. Think of them as a hybrid between a savings bond and an annuity. You'll rarely encounter them in practice, but they may appear on your exam.
            </p>

            <p>The other two types are where the action is.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="management">
            <h2>Management Companies</h2>

            <p>
                Management companies are <span class="key-term">actively managed</span> portfolios of securities. A fund manager—called an <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span>—makes decisions about what to buy and sell based on the fund's <span class="key-term">investment objective</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the key distinction: someone is actively making decisions. Whether those decisions add value after fees is a debate that has launched a thousand academic papers.
            </p>

            <h3>Open-End Management Companies – MUTUAL FUNDS</h3>

            <p>When most people say "mutual fund," they mean an open-end management company. Here's what defines them:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Can only issue common stock</strong> — no bonds or preferred shares</li>
                <li><strong>The number of shares is "open-ended"</strong> — the fund creates new shares when investors buy and retires shares when they sell</li>
                <li><strong>Shares are non-negotiable</strong> — you can't sell your shares to another investor on an exchange</li>
                <li><strong>Shares are redeemed</strong> at the Net Asset Value (NAV) — the fund itself buys back your shares</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The "open-ended" nature is crucial. When you invest $10,000 in a mutual fund, the fund creates new shares for you. When you withdraw, those shares disappear. The fund is constantly expanding and contracting.
            </p>

            <h3>Closed-End Management Companies – PUBLICLY TRADED FUNDS</h3>

            <p>Closed-end funds work differently:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Can issue stocks or bonds</strong></li>
                <li><strong>One-time stock issuance</strong> — after the IPO, no new shares are created</li>
                <li><strong>Shares trade on an exchange or OTC</strong> — like regular stocks</li>
                <li><strong>Not redeemable</strong> — the fund doesn't buy back shares; you sell to another investor</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Premium and Discount</div>
                <p>
                    Because closed-end fund shares trade on the open market, they can trade at a <strong>premium</strong> or <strong>discount</strong> to their NAV. If a fund holds $100 million in securities but investors are pessimistic about its prospects, it might trade at $95 million (a 5% discount). If investors are enthusiastic, it might trade at $105 million (a 5% premium).
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>This creates arbitrage opportunities that don't exist with open-end funds—and exam questions that definitely do.</p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The exam loves to test the differences between open-end and closed-end funds. Remember: open-end = continuous issuance and redemption at NAV; closed-end = one-time issuance, trades on exchange, can trade at premium or discount.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="uits">
            <h2>Unit Investment Trusts</h2>

            <p>
                Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) take a different approach: they assemble a fixed portfolio and hold it. No active management. No trading. Just... holding.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Issue <span class="key-term">shares of beneficial interest</span> representing an undivided interest in the trust</li>
                <li>Have a <span class="key-term">termination date</span> — the trust eventually winds down</li>
                <li>Have <span class="key-term">no board of directors</span> — there's a trustee instead</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fixed UIT</h3>

            <p>The classic UIT:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Selects a fixed portfolio of unmanaged securities</li>
                <li>Traditionally bonds (hence the "fixed" name)</li>
                <li>Once selected, the portfolio doesn't change</li>
                <li>Matures at a fixed date</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you want to know exactly what you own and don't want anyone tinkering with it, a fixed UIT delivers that certainty.</p>

            <h3>Non-Fixed UIT</h3>

            <p>Non-fixed UITs invest in mutual funds, typically within insurance company products:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Variable Annuities</span> are the primary example</li>
                <li>Use investment companies to provide investment options</li>
                <li>Popular for retirement planning</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The "non-fixed" refers to the fact that the underlying mutual funds are actively managed, even though the UIT structure itself is passive.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="lookalikes">
            <h2>The Imposters: What Looks Like an Investment Company But Isn't</h2>

            <p>Here's where the SIE exam gets sneaky—and where real-world confusion lives.</p>

            <p>You'll encounter products that <em>look</em> like investment companies, <em>act</em> like investment companies, and <em>compete</em> with investment companies. But legally? They're something else entirely. Understanding why matters for the exam and for not looking foolish in a client meeting.</p>

            <h3>The VIP Club Analogy</h3>

            <p>Think of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a VIP club with strict rules. If you're inside the club, you must:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Register with the SEC</li>
                <li>Follow diversification requirements</li>
                <li>Have a board of directors (with independent members)</li>
                <li>Limit how much leverage you can use</li>
                <li>Provide detailed disclosures to investors</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These rules exist to protect everyday investors. But they're also expensive and restrictive. So naturally, clever financial engineers found ways to build similar products that stay <em>outside</em> the club—accessing the same markets without the same oversight.</p>

            <h3>The Lineup: In vs. Out</h3>

            <div class="comparison-table">
                <table>

            </div>

            <h3>Why Each Imposter Escapes</h3>

            <h4>Hedge Funds: The Private Party</h4>
            <p>Hedge funds use the "private fund" exemption. The logic: if you're only selling to sophisticated, wealthy investors (accredited investors), they don't need the same protection as regular folks. They can presumably look out for themselves.</p>
            <p><strong>The trade-off:</strong> Hedge funds can use unlimited leverage, short selling, derivatives—whatever they want. But they can't advertise to the public or accept investments from regular investors.</p>

            <h4>REITs: The Real Estate Loophole</h4>
            <p>The 1940 Act regulates companies that invest in <em>securities</em>. REITs primarily invest in <em>real estate</em>—actual buildings, not stocks and bonds. Congress created a separate regime for REITs in 1960 with its own rules (the 75% income test, 90% distribution requirement, etc.).</p>
            <p><strong>The irony:</strong> A REIT that owns 50 office buildings isn't an "investment company." But a mutual fund that owns stock in 50 office-building-owning corporations IS an investment company. Same economic exposure, different legal treatment.</p>

            <h4>ETNs: The Debt Disguise</h4>
            <p>This is the cleverest escape. When you buy an ETN, you're not buying a share of a portfolio. You're <em>lending money to a bank</em>, and the bank promises to pay you based on an index's performance.</p>
            <p>There's no pool of assets. No portfolio. Just a bank's promise. That makes it a debt security, not an investment company.</p>
            <p><strong>The catch:</strong> If the bank fails (see: Lehman Brothers, 2008), you're an unsecured creditor. No underlying assets to claim.</p>

            <h4>Commodity ETFs: The "Not Securities" Play</h4>
            <p>Some ETFs hold physical commodities—actual gold bars in a vault, for example. The 1940 Act regulates investment in <em>securities</em>. Gold bars aren't securities. Neither is oil, wheat, or silver.</p>
            <p><strong>Exam trap:</strong> Most ETFs (like S&P 500 trackers) ARE investment companies. But commodity-based ETFs often aren't. The exam may test this distinction.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Why This Matters Beyond the Exam</div>
                <p>When a product ISN'T an investment company, it means less regulatory protection for investors. No diversification requirements. No leverage limits. No mandatory board oversight. That doesn't make these products bad—but it means you need to understand the risks differently.</p>
                <p>A client who thinks an ETN is "basically an ETF" is dangerously wrong. They're exposed to issuer credit risk that ETF holders don't face. Knowing the difference isn't just exam fodder—it's your job.</p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Exam Alert:</strong> The SIE loves asking "Which of the following IS/ISN'T an investment company under the 1940 Act?" Know that hedge funds, REITs, and ETNs are OUT, while mutual funds, most ETFs, and closed-end funds are IN. The key word is "securities"—if it doesn't invest primarily in securities, it probably isn't a 1940 Act investment company.</p>
