# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Broken NO FOMO Site

## The Problem
Your site at https://drewgarraway.com/nofomo/ is serving the wrong files and is completely broken.

## The Fix Is Ready!
All production files have been prepared and committed locally. You just need to push them.

## Step 1: Push the Fix (Choose One Method)

### Option A: Using Git Command Line
```bash
cd /Users/drewgarraway/Documents/GitHub/drew-garraway-consulting
git push origin main
# OR if you use SSH:
git push ssh main
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Select the `drew-garraway-consulting` repository
3. You'll see "1 commit to push" with message "ðŸš€ Fix production deployment"
4. Click "Push origin"

### Option C: Manual Fix via FTP/cPanel
If Git push doesn't trigger deployment, manually upload these files:
1. Navigate to `/Users/drewgarraway/Documents/GitHub/drew-garraway-consulting/nofomo/`
2. Upload these to your server's `/nofomo/` directory:
   - `index.html` (the one with script src="/nofomo/assets/index-BL9Y1Jhg.js")
   - `assets/` folder containing:
     - `index-BL9Y1Jhg.js`
     - `index-CqbX8Cro.css`

## What This Fix Does
- âœ… Replaces development index.html with production version
- âœ… Includes compiled JavaScript instead of raw JSX
- âœ… Properly references `/nofomo/assets/` paths
- âœ… Makes the site functional immediately

## Verification
After deployment, check:
1. Go to https://drewgarraway.com/nofomo/
2. View page source
3. Confirm you see: `<script type="module" crossorigin src="/nofomo/assets/index-BL9Y1Jhg.js"></script>`
4. NOT: `<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>`

## Files Changed
```
nofomo/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (FIXED - now production version)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-BL9Y1Jhg.js (production JavaScript)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index-CqbX8Cro.css (production styles)
```

## The site will work immediately after these files are deployed!
