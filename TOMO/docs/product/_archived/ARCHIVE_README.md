# Archived Product Documents

**Status:** ARCHIVED - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE

## Why These Files Are Here

These documents contain **historical product specifications** that have been superseded by newer documentation. They are preserved for:

1. **Historical reference** - Understanding product evolution
2. **Future feature extraction** - Coach and Gym Owner features are documented here for Phase 4+
3. **Decision context** - Why certain decisions were made

## Coach & Gym Owner Features

**`/TOMO/docs/project/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`**

This extraction ensures the deferred scope is preserved without cluttering active documentation.
