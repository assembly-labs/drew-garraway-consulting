# TOMO First Principles

> The non-negotiable beliefs that guide every decision.

---

## 1. Reflection Is the Foundation

**Structured reflection is the single strongest predictor of elite development.**

We don't just capture data—we facilitate reflection. Every post-training moment is an opportunity to ask: What worked? What needs improvement? What will I focus on next?

This isn't journaling for its own sake. Research across hundreds of studies with elite athletes shows that deliberate reflection separates those who improve from those who plateau. The data we capture exists to serve reflection. The prompts we design exist to make reflection effortless.

**TOMO is a reflection tool that happens to store data—not a database that happens to have a notes field.**

### Examples

**Do:** After logging a session, prompt with "What's one thing you want to focus on next time?" This seeds the next training session with intention.

**Do:** Surface a monthly reflection card: "You trained 12 times this month. Your notes mention 'half guard' in 8 sessions—what's clicking? What's still frustrating?"

**Don't:** Build a "quick log" mode that captures only duration, training type, and intensity—skipping the reflective prompts. Data without reflection is just noise.

---

## 2. Capture Important Data, Easily

**The 90-second window is sacred.**

Post-training, users have depleted glucose, elevated cortisol, and 20-40% reduced decision-making capacity. They're standing in a parking lot, sweaty, exhausted, wanting to go home. This is the *only* moment when training details are fresh—and it's the *worst* moment to ask for effort.

Voice-first. One question at a time. Huge touch targets. Skip always available.

Every friction point we add is a reason to skip. Every skip is a missed reflection. Missed reflections compound into stalled development.

**If logging feels like work, it won't happen.**

### Examples

**Do:** Default to voice input with a single tap. The prompt says "How'd it go?" not "Please describe your training session including techniques practiced, sparring rounds, and notable observations."

**Do:** Show a large "Skip" button on every optional field. Copy: "Skip for now" (not "Skip" which sounds dismissive, or worse, no skip option at all).

**Don't:** Require users to categorize techniques from a dropdown menu before saving. If they mumbled "worked on kimuras," we extract "kimura" and move on—we don't interrupt to ask "Is this a submission, sweep, or guard pass?"

---

## 3. Process Over Outcome

**Technique development and execution quality matter more than belts or competition records.**

Sports psychology research shows process goals produce 10x larger effects than outcome goals. Yet BJJ culture obsesses over belt promotions and podium finishes.

We center the experience on *how* someone is training—their technique refinement, their consistency, their learning patterns. Belts and competitions are milestones, not measures of worth. We track them, but we don't optimize for them.

**"What did you work on today?" matters more than "When's your next promotion?"**

### Examples

**Do:** The dashboard headline stat is "Sessions This Month" or "Current Focus: Half Guard"—not "Days Until Expected Promotion" or "Competition Record: 3-2."

**Do:** When someone logs a competition loss, prompt: "What did you learn? What felt different under pressure?" Frame it as data, not failure.

**Don't:** Send push notifications like "You're 6 months from your typical blue belt timeline!" or feature a "promotion countdown" widget. This shifts focus from training quality to belt-watching.

---

## 4. Be Helpful

**Usefulness beats cleverness.**

Every feature must answer: "How does this actually help someone train better, stay consistent, or understand their progress?" If we can't answer clearly, we don't build it.

We're not here to impress with technology or data science. We're here to help people stick with a hard thing they've chosen to do. Simple, useful, reliable.

### Examples

**Do:** "You've been caught by guillotine in 4 of your last 6 sessions. Worth asking your coach about guillotine defense—or drilling chin tucks and posture." Surface patterns that point to specific skill gaps.

**Do:** "Your armbar attempts have been failing consistently. Which part is breaking down—the grip break, hip positioning, or leg control? Isolating the step helps fix it." Help users think about *where* in a technique they're getting stuck.

**Don't:** Add a social feed showing what other users are training. Cool? Maybe. Helpful for individual reflection and improvement? No. It's a distraction dressed as a feature.

---

## 5. Belt Psychology Shapes Everything

**Each belt level is a different psychological journey.**

A white belt's survival mode is fundamentally different from a purple belt's systems thinking. The same feature, shown the same way, fails both. We adapt metrics, messaging, content, and interventions based on where someone is in their journey.

- **White belts** need survival framing and consistency celebration
- **Blue belts** need identity support through the plateau
- **Purple+ belts** need depth, systems tracking, and teaching tools

This isn't personalization for its own sake—it's recognizing that practitioners at different stages need different support.

### Examples

**Do:** For a white belt who logged 3 sessions this week: "3 sessions—that's exactly how consistency builds. Keep showing up." For a purple belt with the same data: "Solid week. Your notes show continued half guard focus—you're 6 weeks into this system now."

**Do:** White belt dashboard shows "Sessions This Month" as the hero stat. Purple belt dashboard shows "Technique Depth" or "Systems in Development."

**Don't:** Show a white belt their "submission rate" or "guard retention percentage." They're in survival mode—these stats are meaningless or demoralizing. Save advanced metrics for practitioners ready to use them.

---

## 6. Respect the Journey's Difficulty

**BJJ is hard. We don't pretend otherwise.**

No "hacks." No "secrets." No promises of faster promotions. The path from white belt to black belt takes 12-15 years on average. 70-90% of white belts quit within their first year. We honor this difficulty by being honest about it.

The struggle *is* the path. We illuminate it—we don't trivialize it.

### Examples

**Do:** Onboarding copy: "BJJ is a long road—most people quit in the first year. TOMO helps you be one of the ones who doesn't." Honest, respectful, motivating.

**Do:** When someone logs a frustrating session: "Hard days are part of it. The fact that you're logging means you're still in it." Acknowledge reality without toxic positivity.

**Don't:** Marketing copy like "3 shortcuts to faster submissions" or "What upper belts don't want you to know." There are no shortcuts. There are no secrets. Anyone promising hacks is selling something—and it isn't progress.

## 7. Amplify Coaches, Never Replace Them

**We're the training partner, not the instructor.**

The coach-student relationship is sacred in BJJ. We provide data, patterns, and insights that help practitioners (and eventually coaches) see what they might otherwise miss. We never contradict a coach. We never position ourselves as the authority on someone's game.

Our AI is a knowledgeable training partner—supportive, informed, grounded. Not a guru, not a substitute for real instruction.

### Examples

**Do:** "Your notes mention struggling with guard retention—this might be worth bringing up with your coach." We suggest conversations, not solutions.

**Do:** Future feature: "Share with Coach" button that exports a training summary. Help the coach see patterns they might miss. Amplify their role.

**Don't:** AI response like "Your armbar setup is wrong. Here's the correct technique..." We don't teach technique. We don't correct form. That's the coach's job, and they can see things we can't.

---

## 8. Connection Matters

**Relatedness is a basic psychological need—not a nice-to-have.**

Self-Determination Theory identifies three core needs for sustained motivation: autonomy, competence, and **relatedness**. Meta-analysis of 43,675 athletes shows that supporting these needs correlates strongly with motivation and persistence. Relatedness—meaningful connection with coaches and training partners—is why people stay when training gets hard.

No one gets better at BJJ alone. The training partner who lets you work a new sweep. The upper belt who explains what you're missing. The coach who sees your progress when you can't. Research with Olympic medalists found the coach-athlete relationship "instrumental in helping athletes perform well." Quality relationships also protect against burnout (r = -0.638 with autonomy-supportive coaching).

We design to strengthen these bonds—acknowledging training partners, supporting coach-practitioner communication, and building community features that deepen belonging. Individual reflection is our starting point, but connection is where long-term retention lives.

### Examples

**Do:** Session logging includes an optional "Who did you train with?" field. Over time, surface: "You've trained with Marcus 23 times—your most frequent partner."

**Do:** Monthly insight: "Your best sessions (by your own ratings) tend to be when you train with upper belts. Something to think about."

**Don't:** Build isolated "personal best" leaderboards that pit users against each other. Connection means supporting relationships, not manufacturing competition between strangers.

---

## 9. Specificity Over Encouragement

**"Your triangle setups improved 40% this month" beats "You're doing great!"**

Hollow positivity erodes trust. Our users are adults who've chosen a difficult path. They want clarity, not cheerleading. We give concrete feedback: numbers, patterns, observations.

High-information feedback is brief, specific, and technique-focused. It includes what was correct, what needs change, and how to make that change. When we celebrate, we're celebrating something specific.

### Examples

**Do:** "You trained 14 times in November—your most consistent month since starting. Half guard appeared in 9 sessions." Numbers, patterns, specifics.

**Do:** Post-session: "Logged. You mentioned 'armbar from closed guard'—that's the 4th time this month. Building a pattern." Observation, not evaluation.

**Don't:** "Amazing work this week! Keep it up, champion!" This is empty noise. It sounds like a fitness app that doesn't actually know anything about the user. We know things—we should say them.

---

## 10. Two User States, Not One

**Exhausted logging and relaxed browsing are fundamentally different.**

| Context | State | Design |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Session Logging** | Exhausted, 90-second window | Minimal friction, voice-first, one question at a time, 80px touch targets |
| **Stats, Techniques, Journal** | Relaxed, unlimited time | Rich data welcome, exploration encouraged, standard UX patterns |

Brief daily capture (under 4 minutes) for compliance. Deeper periodic review (monthly/quarterly) for insight. Designing for one state and applying it to both fails everyone.

### Examples

**Do:** Session logger: massive "Done" button, voice input, single-field focus. Stats page: dense data tables, multiple charts, expandable sections. Different states, different designs.

**Do:** Session logger prompts: "How'd it go?" (one question, open-ended). Stats page: "View detailed technique breakdown" (invites exploration).

**Don't:** Apply "exhausted user" simplicity to the stats page ("just show one number!") or apply "browsing user" complexity to session logging ("select techniques from this 50-item dropdown"). Match the design to the state.

---

## 11. The Flashlight, Not the Path

**We make progress visible. We don't dictate what progress means.**

BJJ's informal promotion culture means practitioners often can't see what their coaches see. We give them a mirror: their patterns, their consistency, their growth over time. We display clear skill progressions and improvement trajectories—visible competence growth builds self-efficacy.

Every practitioner defines their own success. Competitors, hobbyists, self-defense focused, those training for mental health—all valid paths. We illuminate where they've been. They decide where to go.

### Examples

**Do:** "You've logged 47 sessions focused on guard work." Observation. What the user does with this information is their choice.

**Do:** Show training patterns without judgment: "You train mostly mornings, mostly gi, mostly drilling." Data, not prescription.

**Don't:** "You should focus more on no-gi to be well-rounded" or "Competitors your level typically train 5x/week." We don't tell users what their journey should look like. That's between them and their coach.

---

## 12. No Gamification

**Belts are earned, not unlocked.**

We don't use "level up," "achievement unlocked," or "streak broken" language. Belt promotions aren't game mechanics—they represent years of physical and mental development. We track progress without trivializing it.

We celebrate consistency because showing up is within a practitioner's control. But we never shame gaps. Life happens. "Welcome back" beats "You broke your streak."

### Examples

**Do:** After a gap in training: "Welcome back. Your last session was 3 weeks ago—you worked on half guard." Neutral, informative, no judgment.

**Do:** Milestone message: "100 sessions logged. That's real consistency." Simple acknowledgment, no confetti explosion or "ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED" banner.

**Don't:** "You're on a 7-day streak! Don't break it!" or "You lost your streak—start again." Streaks create anxiety, shame gaps, and prioritize arbitrary metrics over sustainable practice. A practitioner who trains 3x/week for years beats someone chasing daily streaks who burns out in months.

## Quick Gut-Check

Before any decision, ask:

1. Does this facilitate reflection?
2. Does this make capturing data easier?
3. Does this focus on process over outcome?
4. Is this actually helpful?
5. Does this adapt to belt psychology?
6. Does this respect the difficulty of the journey?
7. Does this amplify coaches rather than replace them?
8. Does this strengthen connection?
9. Is this specific rather than vague?
10. Are we designing for the right user state?
11. Are we illuminating, not prescribing?
12. Are we avoiding gamification?

*These principles don't change. Features, UI, technology—all negotiable. These beliefs are not.*
