**Looking for iOS Developer (React Native/Expo) - BJJ Training App**

Hey everyone - I'm looking for a React Native developer to help bring a passion project to life.

**The Project:** TOMO - a voice-first training journal for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Users speak after training, AI extracts the data. No typing with sweaty hands in the gym parking lot.

**What Exists:** Fully functional web prototype (50K+ lines of TypeScript/React). All screens built, design system complete. See it live: https://bjjj.pages.dev

**What I Need:** Convert to native iOS via React Native/Expo, add real voice recording + transcription, connect to Supabase backend, get to TestFlight.

**Ideal Candidate:**
- Strong React Native / Expo experience
- Supabase or similar BaaS
- iOS App Store submission experience
- **Bonus: You train martial arts / BJJ** (you'll actually understand what users need)

Timeline: ~10-12 weeks to TestFlight

If this sounds like your thing, DM me or reach out at drew@assemblylabs.co

**Seeking iOS Developer for Voice-First BJJ Training App**

I'm looking for a React Native developer to help convert a web prototype into a native iOS application.

**The project:** TOMO is a voice-first training journal for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners. The core insight is simple - after training, you're exhausted. Typing is the last thing you want to do. So users speak naturally, and AI extracts structured session data.

**What exists today:** A production-quality web prototype with 50K+ lines of TypeScript/React, 8 complete feature screens, and a full design system. You can try it at https://bjjj.pages.dev

**What I need:** A developer (or small team) to build the native iOS app using React Native and Expo, integrate voice recording with AssemblyAI transcription, connect to a Supabase backend, and get us to TestFlight.

**Ideal fit:**
- Proven React Native / Expo experience
- Familiarity with Supabase or similar backend-as-a-service
- iOS App Store submission track record
- Bonus points if you train martial arts or BJJ - you'll intuitively understand the user experience we're building for

Timeline is approximately 10-12 weeks to TestFlight.

If this resonates with you or someone in your network, I'd love to connect. Feel free to reach out directly or email drew@assemblylabs.co.
