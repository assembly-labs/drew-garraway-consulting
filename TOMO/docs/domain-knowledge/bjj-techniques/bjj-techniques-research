## Guard positions: The foundation of bottom game

The guard represents BJJ's most distinctive contribution to martial arts—the ability to fight effectively from one's back. Guard techniques fall into three major categories: closed guard fundamentals, half guard systems, and the modern open guard meta.

### Closed guard (Guarda Fechada)

The closed guard serves as every practitioner's first guard, introduced at **white belt** and refined throughout one's career. The position involves wrapping legs around an opponent's torso with ankles crossed behind their back.

**Core Sweeps:**
| Technique | Portuguese | Key Points | Common Errors | Belt Level |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Scissor Sweep | Tesoura | Knee shield + sleeve control, scissor legs together | Opening guard too early, not controlling sleeve | White |
| Hip Bump Sweep | Raspagem de quadril | Post hand, sit up explosively, throw over shoulder | Hesitating on sit-up, not controlling arm | White |
| Flower/Pendulum Sweep | Raspagem Flor | Control sleeve + pants, pendulum motion with leg | Insufficient momentum, releasing grips | White/Blue |
| Elevator Sweep | Raspagem elevador | When opponent stands, underhook leg, elevator motion | Not maintaining wrist control | White |
| Overhead/Balloon Sweep | Raspagem por cima | Feet on hips, pull forward, roll overhead | Feet slipping off hips | White/Blue |

**Primary Submissions:**
| Technique | Japanese/Portuguese | Execution | Gi/No-Gi | Belt |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|----------|------|
| Triangle Choke | Sankaku-jime / Triângulo | Leg over neck, lock figure-four, cut angle, squeeze | Both | White |
| Armbar | Juji-gatame / Chave de braço | Control arm, swing leg over face, pinch knees, extend hips | Both | White |
| Kimura | Gyaku ude-garami | Figure-four on wrist, rotate arm behind back | Both | White |
| Cross Collar Choke | Estrangulamento cruzado | Deep cross grips, pull elbows in | Gi only | White |
| Omoplata | Ashi-garami (shoulder) | Leg over shoulder, sit up, apply forward pressure | Both | Blue |
| Guillotine | Guilhotina | Wrap neck from front headlock, chin-strap grip, crunch | Both | White |

**Posture Breaking Principles:** Always break opponent's posture before attacking. Use collar grips to pull down, climb legs high on their back, and create angles. Chain attacks together—triangle leads to armbar leads to omoplata.

---

### Half guard systems (Meia Guarda)

Half guard evolved from a "last resort" position into one of BJJ's most versatile offensive platforms, popularized by **Roberto "Gordo" Correa** in the 1990s.

**Knee Shield / Z-Guard (Blue Belt):**
The knee shield creates a barrier using the shin across the opponent's torso. Primary attacks include the John Wayne sweep (trap posting arm, roll underneath), kimura setups, and triangle entries. The position works in both gi and no-gi.

**Lockdown System (10th Planet):**
Created by Eddie Bravo, the lockdown involves triangling your legs around the opponent's trapped leg with your bottom foot hooking their ankle.

| Lockdown Technique | Execution | Belt Level |
|--------------------|-----------|------------|
| Electric Chair Sweep | Secure lockdown, underhook hip and far leg, "whip up" extension | Blue/Purple |
| Old School Sweep | From lockdown with underhook, grab far foot, come to knees | Blue |
| Calf Slicer | Transition from lockdown position, compress calf | Brown/Black only |

**Deep Half Guard (Blue/Purple Belt):**
Dive underneath opponent with head near their knee, wrap arm around leg. Sweeps include the Homer Simpson sweep (grab belt, roll under) and waiter sweep (control far leg like a tray). Deep half provides excellent leg lock entries to toe holds and kneebars.

**Underhook Half Guard:**
The underhook is the **most critical control** in half guard. Must be on your side, not flat. Fight for the underhook on the far arm, control hip, and work toward the "dogfight" position for back takes or sweeps. Key practitioners include Lucas Leite (Coyote half guard system), Bernardo Faria, and Tom DeBlass.

---

### Open guard systems

Modern BJJ features numerous specialized open guards, each with distinct mechanics and attack patterns.

**De La Riva Guard (Guarda De La Riva)** — Blue/Purple Belt
Created by Ricardo De La Riva in the 1980s, DLR involves hooking the outside leg around the opponent's lead leg with foot behind their knee.

| DLR Technique | Description | Level |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Basic DLR Sweep | Control sleeve + ankle, extend, sweep | Blue |
| Berimbolo | Invert under hips, spin to take back | Purple/Brown |
| Kiss of the Dragon | Spin under from RDLR to back take | Purple |

**Reverse De La Riva (RDLR):** Hook inside and around opponent's leg (opposite of DLR). Excellent against knee slice passes and for leg entanglement entries.

**Spider Guard (Gi Only)** — Blue Belt
Control both sleeves with feet on biceps. Creates maximum distance and control. Primary attacks include overhead sweeps, triangles, and omoplatas.

**Lasso Guard (Gi Only)** — Blue Belt
Wrap leg around opponent's arm at bicep level while controlling sleeve. Creates strong single-arm control for omoplata and triangle setups.

**Butterfly Guard** — White/Blue Belt
Sitting position with both feet hooked inside opponent's thighs. Popularized by Marcelo Garcia.
- **Basic Butterfly Sweep:** Underhook + overhook, lean toward overhook side, elevate with hook
- **Arm Drag to Back:** Drag arm across body, get behind for back take

**X-Guard** — Blue/Purple Belt
Developed by Alexandre "Gigi" Paiva, popularized by Marcelo Garcia. One leg behind opponent's knee, other pushing hip, arms control ankle. Excellent for technical stand-up sweeps and leg lock entries.

**Single Leg X / Ashi Garami** — Blue/Purple Belt
Isolates one leg completely. One leg inside hooking behind knee, other pushing hip. **Essential for modern leg lock systems.** Legal straight ankle locks from here at all belts; heel hooks only at brown/black no-gi.

**Worm Guard (Gi Only)** — Purple/Brown Belt
Created by Keenan Cornelius in 2014. Extract opponent's lapel, pass under their leg, wrap around your shin. Creates extremely strong connection for sweeps and back takes. Related systems include Squid Guard, Gubber Guard, and De La Worm.

**Rubber Guard (10th Planet)** — Purple Belt
Eddie Bravo's system requiring flexibility. Pull own leg behind opponent's head from closed guard, reaching "Mission Control" position. Attacks include omoplata, triangle, and the gogoplata (shin across throat).

**50/50 Guard** — Purple/Brown Belt
Equal leg entanglement where both players have similar position. Popularized by the Mendes Brothers and Ryan Hall. Primary attacks are straight ankle locks (all belts) and heel hooks (brown/black no-gi only).

### Guard retention principles

**The Four Pillars of Guard Retention:**
1. **Framing** — Use arms and legs as structural barriers, not muscular pushing
2. **Hip Movement** — Shrimping creates space to reinsert guards
3. **Leg Pummeling** — Circular rotations to recover hooks when beaten
4. **Four Points of Contact** — Maintain connection with both legs and arms

**Key Concepts:** Hide the hip-to-armpit gap (never give this entry point), keep knees to chest, match opponent's movement angle with elbows on mat. When guard is nearly passed: frames → knee shields → hip escape → granby roll if necessary.

---

## Top positions: Controlling and finishing

Dominant top positions represent the highest-scoring and highest-finishing opportunities in BJJ. Understanding variations and attacks from each position is essential.

### Mount (Montada) — 4 Points IBJJF

**Position Variations:**
| Variation | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Low Mount | Sitting on stomach/hips, knees near hips | Maintenance, base |
| High Mount | Knees near armpits, sitting on chest | Arm isolation, submissions |
| S-Mount | One knee beside head, other curled under armpit | Armbar setup, crushing pressure |
| Grapevine Mount | Legs hooked inside opponent's legs | Maximum control, Ezekiel setups |
| Technical Mount | One foot posted, knee across opponent | Transition position |

**Mount Submissions:**
| Technique | Japanese Name | Key Points | Belt |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------|
| Armbar | Juji-gatame | Swing leg over face, pinch knees, thumb up | White |
| Americana | Ude-garami | Figure-four, paint wrist toward hip | White |
| Cross Choke | Jūji-jime | Deep collar grips, cross wrists (Roger Gracie signature) | White |
| Ezekiel | Sode-guruma-jime | Arm behind head, hand through sleeve, forearm across throat | Blue |
| Arm Triangle | Kata-gatame | Walk arm across face, encircle head and arm | Blue |
| Mounted Triangle | Sankaku-jime | When one arm in/one out, swing leg over | Blue |

---

### Side control (Cem Quilos) — 3 Points for pass

**Position Variations:**
| Variation | Japanese | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Standard Cross-Side | Yoko shiho-gatame | Chest-to-chest, perpendicular, underhook + crossface |
| Kesa Gatame | Kesa-gatame | Scarf hold, head locked under armpit |
| 100 Kilos | Cem quilos | Both arms far side, maximum chest pressure |
| Reverse Kesa | Ushiro kesa-gatame | Facing opponent's legs, kimura attacks |
| Twister Side Control | — | Hips toward feet, leg lock setups |

**Side Control Submissions:**
The **arm triangle (kata-gatame)** involves walking the opponent's arm across their face, encircling head and arm, then dismounting to finish. The **D'arce/Brabo choke** threads under the far armpit, around the neck—invented by Joe D'Arce under Renzo Gracie. The **paper cutter choke** uses far collar grip with forearm blade across throat.

---

### Knee on belly (Joelho na Barriga) — 2 Points IBJJF

Japanese: **Uki-gatame** ("floating hold"). Checkpoint position that forces reactions. Knee on stomach/solar plexus, other leg posted wide. Pull weight down with grips (belt + collar in gi). Attacks include armbar (when pushed), baseball bat choke, and cross choke transitions.

---

### Back control — 4 Points IBJJF

**The most dominant position in BJJ** with the highest submission rate.

**Control Methods:**
- **Seatbelt:** One arm over shoulder (choking side), one under armpit, Gable grip
- **Hooks:** Both feet inside opponent's thighs
- **Body Triangle:** Figure-four legs around torso (lock over hip, not ribs)

**Back Submissions:**
| Technique | Names | Key Points | Gi/No-Gi |
|-----------|-------|------------|----------|
| Rear Naked Choke | Mata Leão (PT), Hadaka-jime (JP) | Forearm across throat, hand to bicep, squeeze | Both |
| Bow and Arrow | Arco e Flecha | Deep collar grip + pants grip, stretch like drawing bow | Gi only |
| Short Choke | — | Quick variation targeting front of throat | Both |
| Collar Chokes | Okuri-eri-jime | Cross collar grips from back | Gi only |

**RNC Statistics:** The "lion killer" (mata leão) accounted for **32% of the first 168 UFC submission wins**. Average time to unconsciousness when properly locked: approximately **9 seconds**.

---

### Turtle attacks

**Clock Choke (Relógio)** — Gi Only, Blue Belt
From top turtle, grip far collar with far arm, walk around opponent's head like clock hands, sit hip in front of shoulder.

**Crucifix Position:**
Trap one arm with legs, other arm with arms, forming perpendicular "T" position. Attacks include short choke, collar choke, armbar, and wristlock. Japanese: **Jigoku-jime** ("Hell strangle") for the crucifix choke.

**Back Takes from Turtle:**
- Standard seatbelt → chair sit → roll to back
- Rolling back take when opponent defends hooks
- Knee torque back take (Andre Galvao technique)

---

## Guard passing: Pressure, speed, and precision

Guard passing (Portuguese: **passagem de guarda**) divides into pressure passing, speed passing, and the universally essential knee slice.

### Pressure passes

**Body Lock Pass System** — Blue Belt+
Particularly effective no-gi. Underhook near side, wrap far side, clasp hands under scapula. Elbows control hips to neutralize butterfly hooks. Establish tripod (both feet down, head on mat), use head switch and hip movement to pass. Popularized by Lachlan Giles and Gordon Ryan.

**Over-Under Pass** — White Belt
Pin one leg to mat, underhook other leg. Switch head toward underhooked side, drive forward at angle. Signature technique of Bernardo Faria.

**Stack Pass / Double Under** — White Belt
Swim both arms inside legs, grip near belt/hips. Stack opponent's hips over shoulders, sprawl and pass at angle. Counter-attacks to watch: triangle, omoplata.

**Smash Pass** — White/Blue Belt
From over-under or split legs, fold opponent's legs together, drive knees toward chest. Heavy shoulder pressure, sprawl to pin both legs.

---

### Speed passes

**Toreando (Bullfighter) Pass** — White Belt (Foundational)
Portuguese: **Passagem do toureiro**. Grip opponent's ankles/knees, pin legs to floor, circle around in bullfighter motion, drop shoulder to belly for side control.

**Leg Drag Pass** — Blue Belt
Control one foot and knee of other leg, drag leg across your own leg, sit to trap. Popularized by Mendes Brothers and Fernando "Tererê" Augusto.

**X-Pass** — White/Blue Belt
From headquarters (one in/one out), push knee down while kicking near leg up, arms cross in "X" pattern, land in knee on belly. Chains excellently with leg drag and knee slice.

**Long Step Pass** — Blue Belt
From knee slice position, kick trapped leg straight UP (vertical first), long step away from opponent's legs, land in reverse scarf hold.

**Cartwheel Pass** — Purple Belt+
Against seated/butterfly guard, step outside leg, cartwheel over opponent while controlling wrist, land behind securing seatbelt for back take. Popularized by Nicky Rodriguez at ADCC.

---

### Knee slice / knee cut pass

The **highest-percentage pass in BJJ**, used from white belt through world championships.

**Standard Knee Slice** — White Belt
Portuguese: **Passagem de corte de joelho**. Collar + pants grip (gi) or collar tie + tricep (no-gi). Slice knee across thigh **DOWN toward mat** (not back). Control opposite shoulder to prevent underhook.

**Key Detail (Lucas Lepri):** Drive knee DOWN and THROUGH—not back across thigh.

**Variations:**
- Backstep knee slice (when standard blocked by RDLR)
- Cross-face knee cut (shoulder in jaw throughout)
- Knee slice to mount (continue momentum)
- Knee slice to back take (when opponent turns away)

---

### Passing specific guards

**Passing DLR:** Break the hook (point knee outward, bump thigh back), enter headquarters, then side smash or knee cut.

**Passing RDLR:** X-pass/yogafoot variation (pressure hook with knee, turn inward) or long step (UP first, then away).

**Passing Spider:** Priority is breaking sleeve grips. Duck under extended leg or get double-unders to neutralize bicep control.

**Passing Butterfly:** Don't let opponent sit up—drive them flat. Body lock pass or long step as back hits mat.

**Opening Closed Guard:** Stand up with one foot forward (gravity tires their legs), push knee down, step back. Once open, immediately wedge knee between legs.

**Passing Worm Guard:** Establish far collar control early. Strip lapel grip or pressure through with wide base and low hips.

---

## Escapes: Survival and recovery

**Core Principle:** Address submission threats FIRST, then work escapes. Stay calm—panic wastes energy and creates mistakes. Bridge creates space, shrimp uses it.

### Mount escapes

| Technique | Also Called | Position Recovered | Belt |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------|
| Trap and Roll | Upa, Bridge and Roll | Top position | White |
| Elbow-Knee Escape | Shrimp Escape | Half/Full Guard | White |
| Heel Drag | Foot Drag | Half Guard | White/Blue |
| Foot on Hip | Hydraulic Escape | Guard Recovery | Blue |

**Trap and Roll Execution:** Keep elbows tight, trap opponent's arm (wrist + elbow), hook same-side foot behind their heel, bridge UP toward ceiling (not to side), roll over shoulder. Common error: rolling sideways instead of up and over.

**Elbow-Knee Escape:** Frame across hips, bridge slightly, shrimp away while framing, slide knee between bodies connecting elbow to knee, recover guard.

---

### Side control escapes

**Fundamental Shrimp Escape:** Establish inside frame (near arm on hip, far arm protecting neck). Bridge UP and INTO opponent (not straight up). At peak of bridge, hip escape away. Insert knee immediately. Recover guard.

**Ghost Escape (Blue/Purple):** Frame hip and head, when opponent's arm goes over head, swing legs to create momentum, roll through the "ghost hole."

**Wrestling Up:** Get to side facing opponent, establish underhook with far arm, pop up to knees, drive for reversal.

**Escaping Kesa Gatame:** Get elbow to mat (critical), grab around opponent's far shoulder, turn belly down, get to knees.

---

### Back escapes

**Priority:** Defend choke FIRST, always.

**Standard Escape:** Two hands on choking arm (not one on each). Fall to side of **underhook** arm. Clear bottom hook with scissoring motion. Turn and slide, keeping shoulders to mat. Turn INTO opponent to complete.

**Escaping Body Triangle:** Fall to side with the STRAIGHT leg of triangle (lessens pressure). Hook your leg over opponent's crossed foot. Extend hips to break OR turn belly toward opponent.

---

### Turtle escapes

| Technique | Description | Belt |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Sit-Out | Post hands, swing leg, circle around | White |
| Granby Roll | Roll shoulder-to-shoulder (NOT over neck), drive hips toward opponent | Blue |
| Stand Up in Base | Protect neck, step one foot then other | White |
| Peterson Roll | Trap far arm, roll to trap leg, take back | Purple/Brown |

---

## Standing techniques: Takedowns and clinch work

BJJ incorporates wrestling takedowns, judo throws, and unique clinch work to take the fight to the ground.

### Wrestling takedowns

**Double Leg (Morote-gari)** — White/Blue Belt
Change levels explosively, penetration step, shoulder in hip, drive at 45-degree angle. Head on outside to avoid guillotine. Leads to side control, mount, or top half guard.

**Single Leg** — White/Blue Belt
Penetration step, secure leg behind knee. Finishes include: run the pipe, high lift, trip, sweep, outside turn. Head inside (safer) or outside (more power).

**Ankle Pick** — Blue/Purple Belt
Establish collar tie, pull opponent's posture down, level change and grab ankle while steering down with upper body.

**Snap Down to Front Headlock** — White/Blue Belt
From collar tie, pull head down sharply while stepping back, secure front headlock. Options: guillotine, D'arce, anaconda, go-behind.

---

### Judo throws (Nage-waza)

| Japanese | English | Description | Belt |
|----------|---------|-------------|------|
| O-soto-gari | Major Outer Reap | Reap outside leg while driving backward | White/Blue |
| O-uchi-gari | Major Inner Reap | Reap inside lead leg, drive forward | White/Blue |
| Ko-uchi-gari | Minor Inner Reap | Hook ankle/heel from inside, pull | White/Blue |
| Seoi-nage | Shoulder Throw | 180° turn, load on shoulder, hip throw | Blue/Purple |

| Sumi-gaeshi | Corner Reversal | Hook inner thigh, roll back (like butterfly sweep) | Blue/Purple |
| De-ashi-barai | Advancing Foot Sweep | Sweep foot as opponent steps | Blue/Purple |

---

### Clinch positions

**Underhook Fighting:** Arm under opponent's arm, hand on back. Double unders = dominant position. Fight for inside position with pummeling.

**Collar Tie (Muay Thai Clinch):** Hand behind neck, forearm blocks shoulder. Use for snap downs, ankle picks, knee taps.

**2-on-1 (Russian Tie):** Control wrist + triceps/shoulder. Position body behind their arm line. Attacks: ankle pick, single leg, fireman's carry.

---

### Guard pulling

| Method | Description | Level |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Jumping Closed Guard | Secure grips, jump and wrap (HIGH injury risk—banned in some divisions) | Blue+ |
| Sit-Down Guard Pull | Grip first, sit down quickly, immediately engage guard | White/Blue |
| Collar/Sleeve Pull | Foot on hip, sit back with tension | White/Blue |
| DLR Guard Pull | Sit and immediately hook behind lead leg | Blue/Purple |

---

### Takedown defense

**Sprawl** — White Belt
Explosively drive hips back and down, chest on opponent's upper back, twist hips for maximum pressure. Follow with front headlock, guillotine, or go-behind.

**Whizzer (Overhook)** — White/Blue Belt
Hook over opponent's arm above elbow, pull upward, drive hip into them. Counter to single leg attempts.

---

## Submissions: Chokes, locks, and leg attacks

### Chokes (Estrangulamentos)

**Rear Naked Choke (Mata Leão / Hadaka-jime)** — White Belt
The king of submissions. From back control, choking arm across throat, hand grabs bicep, non-choking arm behind head. Blade of forearm on throat, squeeze while expanding chest.

| Choke | Names | Key Points | Gi/No-Gi | Belt |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|------|

**Heel Hook Warning:** Inside heel hook is the **most dangerous leg lock**—attacks ACL/MCL and comes on extremely fast. Legal only for brown/black belts in no-gi competition.

---

### Leg entanglement positions (Ashi Garami system)

| Position | Description | Primary Attacks |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Standard Ashi Garami / SLX | Outside foot on hip, inside leg hooks thigh | Straight ankle, outside heel hook |

## Conclusion

This database represents a **complete BJJ curriculum from white belt fundamentals through black belt mastery**, organized by the positional hierarchy that defines the art. The progression follows IBJJF standards while incorporating modern innovations like the Danaher leg lock system and Keenan Cornelius's lapel guard developments.

**Key insights for practitioners:** Focus first on closed guard, mount escapes, and side control escapes at white belt. Blue belt should expand into half guard systems and basic open guards. Purple belt opens the door to specialized guards and inversions. Brown belt unlocks the complete leg lock game. Black belt is about refinement, not revolution—mastering what you know rather than constantly adding.

The modern BJJ meta has shifted dramatically toward leg locks in no-gi competition since the **2021 IBJJF rule change** allowing heel hooks for brown and black belts. However, the foundational positions—closed guard, mount, back control—remain as essential as they were in the 1990s. A comprehensive game requires proficiency across all positional families, with depth developed in systems that match your body type and personality.
