# TOMO Messaging Guidelines

> **Personalized communication templates for AI responses, notifications, and UI copy.**

---

## Core Principle

**Celebrate relative progress, not absolute metrics.**

A 47-year-old training 2x/week is crushing it. A 27-year-old competitor training 2x/week may be slipping. The same data point means different things to different people.

---

## Training Frequency Benchmarks (By Age)

Use these to calibrate encouragement and concern.

| Age Group | "Solid" | "Strong" | "Elite" | Peer Avg |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| 18-25 | 3x/week | 4x/week | 5-6x/week | 3.5x/week |
| 26-35 | 2-3x/week | 3-4x/week | 4-5x/week | 3x/week |
| 36-45 | 2x/week | 3x/week | 4x/week | 2.5x/week |
| 46-55 | 2x/week | 2-3x/week | 3x/week | 2x/week |
| 56+ | 1-2x/week | 2x/week | 3x/week | 1.5x/week |

**Competitor modifier:** +1-2 sessions expected across all age groups

## Personalized Message Examples

### By Persona Context

**For `newcomer` (new white belt, 2x/week, 28yo):**
```
"2 sessions this week. You showed up twice more than the people
who said 'I'll start Monday.' That's the whole game."
```

**For `survivor` (6-18mo white belt, 3x/week, 34yo):**
```
"3 sessions this week puts you in the top 40% of practitioners
balancing work and family. Solid commitment."
```

**For `plateau-warrior` (blue belt, plateau phase):**
```
"You've logged 47 sessions focused on half guard.
Something is building—even when it doesn't feel like it."
```

**For `newcomer-female` (Maya, 28yo, first month):**
```
"Progress against partners 50 lbs heavier looks different.
Survival time IS your metric right now. You're building something real."
```

**For `specialist` (purple belt, competitor):**
```
"4 sessions this week. On track for competition prep.
Consider adding an open mat for extra rounds."
```

---

## Streak & Consistency Messaging

### Philosophy

- **Never punish gaps.** Life happens.
- **Celebrate consistency over intensity.** Showing up matters most.
- **Frame breaks as normal,** not failures.

### Active Streak Templates

| Milestone | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| Week 2 | "Two weeks straight. Momentum is building." |
| Week 4 | "A full month on the mat. That's when habits stick." |
| Week 8 | "8 weeks. Most people quit by now. You didn't." |
| Week 12 | "3 months consistent. This is who you are now." |

### Streak Broken (Re-engagement)

**After 3-7 days:**
```
"It's been a few days. Ready to get back?
Your [X] session streak was strong—let's build another."
```

**After 1-2 weeks:**
```
"Hey, it's been a minute. Everything okay?
One session resets everything. No pressure."
```

**After 2-4 weeks (gentle intervention):**
```
"We noticed you haven't trained in a while.
Life gets busy—that's okay. When you're ready, we're here."
```

**After 4+ weeks (win-back):**
```
"It's been over a month. If you're stepping away, that's valid.
If you want back in, your history is waiting. No judgment."
```

---

## Re-engagement Triggers

| Signal | Trigger | Intervention |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Missed 1 session vs. normal | 3 days past usual | None (normal variance) |
| Missed 2+ sessions | 7 days past usual | Gentle check-in |
| Training frequency dropped 50%+ | 2-week rolling avg | Supportive message |
| Zero sessions logged | 14+ days | Win-back sequence |
| App opened but no log | 3+ occurrences | Simplify CTA |

### By Persona Type

**For `plateau-warrior` (competitor):**
```
"Training volume is down 40% from last month.
Competition in 6 weeks—intentional deload or life chaos?"
```

**For `survivor` (hobbyist):**
```
"Missed your usual Tuesday session.
Family stuff? Work crunch? Either way,
Thursday's class is still on the schedule."
```

**For `newcomer` (at-risk signals):**
```
"No sessions logged this week. If you're nursing an injury,
rest is training too. If you're just busy, one class
keeps the habit alive."
```

**For `specialist` (self-motivated):**
```
[Minimal intervention—they'll find pushy messages annoying]
"It's been a while. We're here when you're ready."
```

---

## Injury-Aware Messaging

### When User Logs Injury

```
"Noted: [shoulder tweak]. Smart to track it.
Monitor it over next 2-3 sessions. If it persists,
consider letting coach know or seeing a physio."
```

### Return After Logged Injury

```
"First session back after [shoulder] issue.
How did it feel? [Better / Same / Worse]"
```

### High-Risk Pattern Detected

```
"This is your 3rd shoulder-related note in 2 months.
Recurring issues often have root causes—worth investigating?"
```

---

## Belt Progression Context

### For Younger Practitioners (under 30)

```
"18 months at blue belt. Average is 2-3 years.
You're tracking well—purple is coming."
```

### For Older Practitioners (over 40)

```
"14 months at white belt. For practitioners who started
after 40, average time to blue is 18-24 months.
You're right on track."
```

### For Competitors

```
"2 years at purple. Competition-focused practitioners
often spend 3-4 years here—depth over speed."
```

---

## Sparring Performance Context

### After a Tough Session

```
"Rough rounds happen. You logged 5 today—
that's 5 more than the people who stayed home."
```

### Pattern Detected (Recurring Struggle)

```
"You've noted 'guard passing' as a struggle
in 4 of your last 6 sessions. Worth focusing on?"
```

### Positive Pattern

```
"Triangle setups mentioned 3x this month.
Looks like it's becoming a go-to. Nice."
```

---

## Celebration Calibration

### Match Intensity to Achievement

| Achievement | Level | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| First session logged | High | "First one in the books. That's the hardest step." |
| 10 sessions | Medium | "10 sessions logged. You're building something." |
| 50 sessions | High | "50 sessions. Most people never get here." |
| 100 sessions | Very High | "Triple digits. You're a lifer now." |
| 1-year anniversary | Very High | "One year on the mat. That's rarer than you think." |
| Belt promotion | Very High | "Purple belt. Years of work. Earned, not given." |

### Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

| Bad | Why |
|-----|-----|
| "Amazing job logging today!!!!" | Too much for daily action |
| "You're CRUSHING it!!!!" | Empty hype language |
| "Streak broken :(" | Shame-based |
| "You're behind your goals" | Discouraging |
| "Only 2 sessions this week?" | Judgmental |

## Key Moments Map

Understanding when users are receptive to different types of messages.

```
BEFORE CLASS
Physical:  ██████░░░░ Normal
Cognitive: ██████████ High capacity
Emotional: ████████░░ Anticipation, maybe anxiety
→ Show "last session" review. Preview what to work on.

DURING CLASS
Physical:  ██████████ Peak exertion
Cognitive: ██████████ Flow state or survival mode
Emotional: ██████████ Full engagement
→ None. Phone is in bag. User is training.

0-5 MINUTES POST-TRAINING (CRITICAL WINDOW)
Physical:  ██████████ Exhausted, sweaty, hot
Cognitive: ████░░░░░░ 40% impaired
Emotional: ███████░░░ Variable
→ VOICE LOG. ONE tap to start. Talk. ONE tap to save. Done.

5-30 MINUTES POST-TRAINING
Physical:  ██████░░░░ Cooling down
Cognitive: ██████░░░░ Recovering
Emotional: ██████░░░░ Reflective
→ Secondary capture. Optional "add more" prompt.

30+ MINUTES POST-TRAINING
Physical:  ████░░░░░░ Normal
Cognitive: ████████░░ Recovering
Emotional: ████░░░░░░ Disconnected from session
→ Show AI summary. Let them feel proud of logging.

NEXT DAY
Physical:  ██░░░░░░░░ Sore
Cognitive: ██████████ Normal
Emotional: ██████░░░░ Neutral
→ Quick reference cards. 2-min technique review.
```

## Implementation Notes

### User Profile Enrichment

- Capture age at signup (for peer comparison cohorts)
- Infer training goals (competitor vs. hobbyist) from behavior
- Track typical training days/times for anomaly detection

### Message Personalization Engine

- Template system with persona-specific variants
- Dynamic benchmark insertion (percentile calculations)
- Tone adjustment based on user preference signals

### A/B Testing Priorities

- Test celebration intensity levels
- Test re-engagement message timing
- Track which messages correlate with return visits

### Coach Integration

- Flag disengaged students to coaches (with user consent)
- Let coaches customize intervention messages
- Aggregate disengagement trends for gym owners

### Privacy Considerations

- Age-based personalization should be opt-in or inferred
- Never share individual data in peer comparisons
- Allow users to disable motivational messages
