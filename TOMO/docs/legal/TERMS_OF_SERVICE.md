### Our Property

The TOMO name, logo, visual design, user interface, and underlying code are the intellectual property of Drew Garraway Consulting and are protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute any part of the App without our written consent.

### BJJ Knowledge

BJJ techniques, positions, and terminology referenced within the App are part of the public domain of martial arts knowledge. Our presentation, organization, and curation of this information is proprietary, but the underlying martial arts concepts themselves are not.

## 8. Disclaimers

### Not Medical Advice

**TOMO is not a medical application and does not provide medical advice.** The App tracks training data and provides general insights based on your logged sessions. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

- **Consult a qualified healthcare professional** for any injuries, pain, or medical concerns related to your training
- **Do not rely on the App** to diagnose or treat any medical condition
- **Train within your limits** and listen to your body

### Not a Replacement for Your Coach

TOMO is a training journal, not a coach. The App may provide general information about BJJ techniques and training patterns, but:

- **Your coach's guidance takes priority** over any content in the App
- **Belt promotion decisions** are made by your coach and academy, not by the App
- **Technique instruction** in the App is for reference only and does not replace proper instruction from a qualified instructor

### Service Availability

We strive to keep TOMO available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The App may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- Drew Garraway Consulting shall not be liable for any **indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages** arising from your use of or inability to use the App
- Our total liability for any claims related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the **twelve (12) months** preceding the claim
- We are not liable for any **physical injuries** sustained during BJJ training, regardless of whether the App was used to plan, log, or review training sessions
- We are not responsible for the actions, content, or data processing practices of **third-party services** integrated with the App

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Where possible, we will provide notice before termination and an opportunity to export your data.

- Your account will be deactivated immediately
- All personal data will be purged within 30 days

### Effect of Termination

Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law) will remain in effect.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States**, without regard to conflict of law principles.
