## Introduction

Drew Garraway Consulting ("we," "us," or "our") operates the TOMO (友) mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when you use TOMO.

We believe in transparency. This policy is written in plain language so you can understand exactly what happens with your data.

## How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

- **Provide the Service:** Store your training journal, track your belt progression, and maintain your technique library
- **Personalize Your Experience:** Deliver belt-specific insights, training recommendations, and progress summaries tailored to your level
- **Process Voice Recordings:** Transcribe your audio into structured session data using our transcription service

## Voice Data

When you use the voice logging feature:

1. Your audio is recorded on your device
2. The recording is sent to AssemblyAI, our transcription partner, for processing
3. The transcription is returned and stored as structured text in your training journal
4. **Audio recordings are not permanently stored after transcription is complete.** We retain only the text transcription, not the original audio file.

AssemblyAI processes your audio solely for the purpose of transcription. For more information, see AssemblyAI's privacy policy at [https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.assemblyai.com/legal/privacy-policy).
