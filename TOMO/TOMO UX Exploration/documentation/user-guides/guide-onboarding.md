# Getting Started with TOMO

## What It Does

When you first open TOMO, we'll ask a few questions to personalize your experience. This takes about a minute. We need to know your belt level and where you train so we can tailor everything to your journey.

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Welcome

Tap **Get Started** to begin.

### Step 2: About You

Tell us:
- **Your name** - We'll use this throughout the app
- **Your belt** - This shapes how TOMO speaks to you and what content we emphasize
- **Your stripes** - Helps us understand where you are in your current belt

All three are required. Tap **Continue** when done.

### Step 3: Your Training

Tell us:
- **Where you train** - Search for your gym or add it manually if it's not listed
- **How often you want to train** - We'll use this to track your consistency

Below the line, you'll see optional questions about why you train and how long you've been training. Answer these if you want, or skip them entirely.

Tap **Continue** when done.

### Step 4: Almost There

Choose how you want to log sessions:
- **Voice** (Recommended) - Just talk after class. 60 seconds, hands-free.
- **Text** - Type your notes. Traditional journaling.

Voice is pre-selected because most practitioners find it easier right after training when they're tired. You can always change this later in Settings.

Once you've chosen, you'll see two options:
- **Log Your First Session** - Jump straight into logging
- **Explore the app first** - Look around before logging

## Tips

- **Be honest about your belt and stripes.** TOMO uses this to personalize your experience. A white belt with 2 stripes gets different guidance than a purple belt with none.

- **Your gym matters.** We use this to understand your training context. If your gym isn't in our database, add it manually.

- **Voice logging is worth trying.** Most users who try voice stick with it. Talking is faster than typing when you're exhausted after class.

- **Skip what you want.** The optional questions help us personalize further, but they're not required. We'll ask again later if you skip them.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I change my belt level later?**
A: Yes. Go to Profile > Settings and update your belt and stripes anytime you're promoted.

**Q: What if my gym isn't in the list?**
A: Tap "Add my gym manually" and enter your gym's name. City and state are optional.

**Q: Can I switch between voice and text logging?**
A: Yes. Go to Profile > Settings to change your default logging preference. You can also switch on a per-session basis.

**Q: What happens if I close the app during setup?**
A: You'll start from the beginning next time. Setup only takes a minute, so this shouldn't be an issue.

**Q: Why do you need my belt level?**
A: TOMO adapts to where you are in your journey. A white belt needs different support than a purple belt. Your belt level shapes the entire experience.
