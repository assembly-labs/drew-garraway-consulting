## Our Unique Differentiator

**Voice-first logging for exhausted users.**

Every competitor requires manual typing. Our users are:
- Physically drained post-training
- Cognitively fatigued
- Time-constrained (90-second window)

No BJJ app offers voice-first input. We own this niche.

## Recommended Pricing

| Tier | Price | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Free** | $0 | 3 sessions/mo, basic stats |
| **Premium** | $5.99/mo or $49.99/yr | Unlimited voice logging, AI insights, full history |

Undercut BJJ Notes ($9.99), match BJJBuddy, beat Marune on value.

## Go/No-Go Analysis

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Market size | 750K US practitioners, growing |
| Competition | Fragmented, no dominant player |
| Differentiation | Voice-first = defensible moat |
| Pricing headroom | $5-10/mo proven willingness |
| Risk | Execution, not market |

## Decision: GO

**Why:** Clear differentiation (voice-first), proven market ($40-72/yr willingness), no dominant competitor, 15% annual growth. The exhausted-user insight is validated and unaddressed by all competitors.

**Break-even target:** 1,000 paying users at $50/yr = $50K ARR
