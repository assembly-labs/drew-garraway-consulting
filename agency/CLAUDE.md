## Mad Men Era: The Golden Age Lexicon

The 1950s-1980s established advertising's foundational vocabulary, much of which survives today—some sincerely, some as nostalgic callbacks perfect for a heritage-conscious brand.

### Agency Hierarchy and Culture

**The essential divide:**
- **"The Suits"** — Account management and business-side personnel; still used (often pejoratively) by creatives
- **"The Creatives"** — Art directors, copywriters, and creative department staff
- **"Mad Men"** — 1950s slang coined by Madison Avenue advertisers themselves ("Mad" = Madison); now culturally iconic
- **"Rainmaker"** — Executive who brings in major new business; carries genuine respect

**Classic titles still in play:** Account Executive, Creative Director, Art Director, Copywriter, Media Planner, Traffic Manager (now often "Project Manager")

**Period-specific titles:** Copy Chief, Space Buyer, Time Buyer—rarely used today but evocative

**Madison Avenue vernacular:**
- **"Full-service shop"** — Agency offering complete creative, media, and account services
- **"Adland"** — The advertising industry as a whole (now in Merriam-Webster)
- **"Three-Martini Lunch"** — The legendary, leisurely, alcohol-fueled business lunch; became synonymous with 1960s Madison Avenue
- **"The Gray Flannel Suit"** — 1950s executive uniform; from the 1955 novel that defined the era's conformity

### Foundational Strategic Concepts

These philosophies shaped modern marketing language:

- **USP (Unique Selling Proposition)** — Rosser Reeves' 1940s concept: the single distinct benefit making a product superior. Still fundamental
- **"Reason Why" Advertising** — John E. Kennedy/Claude Hopkins concept that ads must provide rational purchase justification; "salesmanship in print"
- **"Sell the sizzle, not the steak"** — Promote emotional benefits over features; quintessential golden-age wisdom
- **Brand Image** — David Ogilvy's emphasis on building consistent brand personality
- **The Big Idea** — Central creative concept; Ogilvy: "Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night"

### Classic Creative Terminology

**Print craft terms (many still current):**
- **Copy/Body Copy/Headline** — The written elements of advertising
- **Tagline/Strapline** — Short memorable phrase (UK prefers "strapline")
- **Comp (Comprehensive)** — Detailed layout resembling finished ad
- **Rough** — Preliminary concept sketch
- **Swipe File** — Collection of good design examples for inspiration
- **Above the Fold** — Premium newspaper position; adapted perfectly to digital

**Legacy terms with nostalgic flavor:** Paste-up, Camera-Ready Art, Station Break

This is where the authentic agency voice lives—the sarcastic, self-deprecating humor that bonds creative professionals over shared frustrations. **Gold for a brewery brand targeting this audience.**

### Client Feedback Translations

The universally mocked disconnect between what clients say and what they mean:

| **"I'll know it when I see it"** | "I have terrible taste and I'd rather you accidentally stumble upon my aesthetic." |
| **"Make it classic but modern"** | "I'm throwing keywords to sound like I know what I'm talking about." |
| **"Do what you think is best"** | "I won't tell you what I like, but I definitely won't like whatever you do." |
| **"This doesn't feel right"** | "This design has misaligned my chakras." |

### The Immortal "MAKE THE LOGO BIGGER"

So universal it spawned **a song by an agency band**, Chrome browser extensions for "instant logo biggification," and endless memes. It's the rallying cry of graphic designers everywhere—and perfect brewery coaster material.
