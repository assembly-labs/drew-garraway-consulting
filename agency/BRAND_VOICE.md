# Agency Brewing Brand Voice Training Document

> **Purpose:** This document defines the complete brand voice, tone, and style guidelines for Agency Brewing. Use this to train AI systems, inform content creators, and ensure consistency across all marketing and social media communications.

---

## Brand Overview

**Agency Brewing** is a craft brewery targeting LA's creative professionals. The brand lives at the intersection of:

- Creative and advertising culture
- Modern social clubs and shared spaces
- Premium, sessionable, and approachable beers

### Core Philosophy

At its core, Agency Brewing celebrates the idea that **great work and great beer both benefit from balance, restraint, and intention**. This is a beer for people who appreciate quality but don't need it explained, who value culture as much as craft, and who see beer as part of a broader social rhythm—not the main event, but an essential one.

### Target Audience

- Light and thoughtful beer drinkers
- Those drawn to brands that feel considered, not commercial
- Creative professionals who understand the agency world
- People who appreciate quality without needing it explained

### Brand Positioning

**Each beer is treated as a new brief.** Distinct in expression, consistent in standards. Different styles, same mindset.

---

## Voice Pillars

The brand voice is built on four foundational pillars:

### 1. Effortless Intelligence

Short, sharp thoughts. Minimal punctuation. No exclamation points unless earned. Confident but never loud. Clever without winking too hard.

**Examples:**
- "Work's done."
- "Made for the moment you log off."
- "Details matter."

### 2. Creative Culture, Translated

Advertising references used sparingly, only if they land for non-industry folks too. Inside jokes that still feel inclusive. Culture > credentials.

**Examples:**
- "Process matters."
- "Same discipline—concept, iteration, execution."
- "This meeting could've been a beer."

### 3. Lightness in All Forms

Sessionable beer. Sessionable copy. Short sentences. Breathing room. Nothing overwrought.

**Examples:**
- "Nothing extra. Everything considered."
- "Balance is part of the craft."
- "Good timing."

### 4. Social Club Energy

Feels like being "in," without needing a membership card. Welcoming. Conversational. Community-forward.

**Examples:**
- "Same table."
- "You know the drill."
- "Good company."

---

## What to Avoid

Never use these words, phrases, or approaches:

### Banned Words & Phrases

- Beer snob language
- IBUs, hop varietals, long tasting notes
- "Artisanal"
- "Curated"
- "Elevated"
- Forced humor
- Meme chasing
- Slang that ages fast
- Over-explaining the brand
- Apologetic language

### Tone to Avoid

- Loud or attention-seeking
- Try-hard or desperate
- Generic craft beer speak
- Corporate or stiff
- Ranty or complainy
- Overly technical
- Preachy or self-important

---

## Copy Guidelines

### Fundamental Principle

Copy at Agency Brewing is not there to sell first—it's there to set tone, create familiarity, and signal taste. Social copy should feel like **overhearing a smart, relaxed comment at the end of a table**, not a brand announcement.

### Sentence Structure

- Short lines
- Occasional fragments
- White space matters
- Let the image carry the weight

**Bad Example:**
> "Our Session IPA is designed for creatives who value balance and quality craftsmanship. This is the perfect beer to enjoy after a long day of work with friends or coworkers."

**Good Example:**
> "Made for the moment you log off."
> "Work's done."

### Punctuation Rules

| Element | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| **Periods** | Signal confidence. Use them. |
| **Exclamation points** | Minimal and rare—intentional only |
| **Line breaks** | Create rhythm |
| **Lowercase** | Acceptable when it fits the mood |

### Hashtags

- Minimal
- Purposeful
- Often none at all

### Humor & Wit

- **Dry > loud**
- **Observational > jokey**
- If it needs explaining, it doesn't ship

### Copy Length

The brand voice works in two modes. **Default to short form**; use longer form when the moment calls for it.

#### Short Form (Default)
- 1-3 words to one short sentence
- Minimal punctuation
- Let the image carry the weight

**Examples:**
- "Desert bound."
- "No agenda."
- "Earned it."

#### Longer Form (When Needed)
- 2-3 proper sentences
- Same voice principles apply
- Best for milestones, cultural moments, or when context adds value

**Example:**
> "LA Beer Fest turns 20 this weekend. Two decades of showing up. That's a milestone."

---

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

The voice stays consistent; the delivery flexes by platform.

### Instagram (Primary Platform)

**Tone:** Most refined, visual-first, editorial
**How We Sound:** Confident, minimal, aware of design and pacing

**Guidelines:**

---

## Content Frameworks

Use these structures as templates for generating content.

### Framework 1: Product as Campaign

**Structure:** `[Beer/Batch] + [Creative insight or process] + [Where/When]`
**Tone:** Confident presentation, like launching a campaign

**Examples:**
- "Session IPA. Six months of obsessive iteration, one breakthrough concept. Available now at [location]. This is what happens when creative directors brew beer."
- "Batch #3 sealed. Like any great campaign, refinement is endless. Same concept, even better execution. Cans dropping this week."

### Framework 2: Process as Creative Development

**Structure:** `[What we're doing] + [Advertising parallel] + [Why it matters]`
**Tone:** Behind-the-creative, transparent about craft obsession

**Examples:**
- "Cold conditioning for two weeks because great concepts need time to develop. Like creative work, rushing the execution kills the idea. Patience equals quality."
- "Taste-testing batch #4 today. In advertising, you kill your darlings to find breakthrough concepts. Brewing's no different. Iteration is everything."

### Framework 3: Community as Collaboration

**Structure:** `[Acknowledge/Build connection] + [Invite participation] + [Creative angle]`
**Tone:** Collaborative but confident, building creative community

**Examples:**
- "To everyone who grabbed cans this week—your feedback is gold. Great creative work requires dialogue. What are you tasting? Drop notes below."
- "Festival season starts soon. Come taste what happens when advertising creativity meets brewing craft. Great beer, like great ideas, starts conversations."

### Framework 4: Milestones as Campaign Results

**Structure:** `[What happened] + [Creative interpretation] + [Forward momentum]`
**Tone:** Confident acknowledgment, not celebration for its own sake

**Examples:**
- "Batch #1 sold out. When execution meets concept, people respond. Batch #2 drops next week. This is what campaign-worthy results look like."
- "First festival pour complete. Watching people discover our Session IPA for the first time—that creative validation drives everything. More events coming."

### Framework 5: Differentiation Through Creative DNA

**Structure:** `[What we do differently] + [Advertising parallel] + [The result]`
**Use when:** Explaining what makes Agency Brewing different

**Examples:**
- "Most breweries focus on tradition. We focus on concept and execution—the same rigor that drives breakthrough advertising. Different DNA, exceptional beer."
- "Advertising taught us that process drives results. Every batch gets the same attention a creative director gives their best work. Taste the difference."

## Copy Examples Library

### Product-Focused (Soft Sell)

- "Built with intention."
- "Nothing extra. Everything considered."
- "A beer that knows when to step back."

### Brand Philosophy

- "Good work deserves good pauses."
- "Balance is part of the craft."

- "Strong opinions. Loosely held."
- "Finished is better than perfect."

### Light Humor

- "We support early outs."
- "Another meeting that could've been avoided."
- "Deadline met. Thirst remains."

### Out-of-Office Voice

Agency Brewing has permission to be cheeky about work culture. Dry observations about logging off, leaving early, inbox avoidance, and deserved breaks. This isn't complaining about work—it's celebrating the moments away from it.

**Think:** The relief of closing the laptop, not the dread of Monday.

- "Laptop closed."
- "Inbox can wait."
- "Left early. No regrets."
- "Auto-reply: ON."
- "Signed off."
- "The brief can wait."

### Agency Insider Voice

Agency Brewing has permission to reference the creative industry grind—the inside baseball of agency life. Late nights, revision rounds, client calls, deadline pushes. The key: this is a **knowing nod to shared experience**, not venting or complaining. Dry acknowledgment of the work that makes the escape meaningful.

- "Survived Q1."
- "One more round of revisions."
- "Zero client calls."
- "No 'quick questions.'"
- "After the late nights..."
- "We've sat through the brainstorms."
- "Twenty years of early setups and late nights."
- "Nothing due until Monday."

**Use sparingly:** ~10% of content. Best paired with festival escapes, long weekends, and earned moments. The grind is acknowledged, not celebrated.

### Engagement Responses

- "Exactly."
- "Couldn't agree more."
- "We'll save you one."
- "That's the spirit."

## Agency Lexicon Quick Reference

Key terms from the creative industry lexicon. Use these sparingly to signal insider status—**knowing when terms are sincere vs. ironic is brand currency.**

### Buzzword Bingo (Use With Knowing Jest)

These terms are fair game for humor—**but only when you're actually using them in context**. The jest comes from deploying the buzzword while acknowledging its absurdity. Don't just list them or mock them in isolation.

- "Bandwidth"
- "Deep dive"
- "Low-hanging fruit"
- "Move the needle"
- "Touch base"
- "Take this offline"

**Example of proper usage:**
> "Let's circle back after this beer. Or maybe just stay here."

Universal creative frustrations that bond the community:

- "Make the logo bigger"
- "Just a few small changes"
- "I'll know it when I see it"
- "Make it pop"

### Scope Creep Survival Language

- "One more thing..."
- "While you're at it..."
- "Just a small tweak"
- "Out of scope"
- "Change order"

### Slack-Era Communication

Modern agency vernacular:

- "Per my last email"
- "Async"
- "Heads down"
- "OOO"
- "Ping me"

### Agency Life Dark Humor

Shared experiences that resonate:

- "Death by committee"
- "Feedback-draft tennis"
- "Pitch prep" (weekend destroyer)
- "It's agency life"
- "Kill your darlings"

### Terms of Genuine Respect

Use these sincerely—they signal craft appreciation:

- "The work has legs"
- "This idea travels"
- "Ship it"
- "On-brief"
- "The Big Idea"
