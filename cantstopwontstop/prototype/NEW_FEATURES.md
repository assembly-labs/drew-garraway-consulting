# New Features Added to Prototype

## Summary
Successfully restructured and expanded the prototype from ~30% to ~70% of MVP features. The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and includes proper state management with data persistence.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. **State Management Layer**
- **`src/context/AppContext.tsx`** - Centralized state management using React Context
  - Manages workout plans, history, and user preferences
  - Provides clean API for all data operations
  - Handles initialization and persistence

### 2. **Local Storage Service**
- **`src/services/StorageService.ts`** - Persistent storage using localStorage
  - Save/load workout plans
  - Save/load workout history
  - Save/load user preferences
  - Handles data serialization automatically

## New Features Implemented

### ✅ **Pre-Flight Configuration Screen**
- **File:** `src/screens/PreFlightScreen.tsx`
- Adjust total workout time with dial/slider (15-120 minutes)
- Display selected plan details
- Show current mode (Challenge/Beast)
- Warning message before starting
- Pulsing "START GRINDING" button

### ✅ **Workout Summary Screen**
- **File:** `src/screens/WorkoutSummaryScreen.tsx`

- Stats cards: Time, Completion %, Exercises completed, Sets completed
- Total volume calculation
- Pauses used (Challenge Mode)
- Exercise breakdown with completion status

### ✅ **Workout History Screen**
- **File:** `src/screens/WorkoutHistoryScreen.tsx`
- Chronological list of past workouts
- Summary stats: Total workouts, This week, Average completion %
- Tap any workout to view detailed summary
- Formatted dates ("Today", "Yesterday", "X days ago")
- Empty state for new users

### ✅ **Plan Management Screen**
- **File:** `src/screens/PlanManagementScreen.tsx`
- View all workout plans
- Create new plan button
- Tap to edit existing plan
- Delete with confirmation modal
- Shows plan metadata (exercises, time, difficulty)

### ✅ **Plan Creation/Editing Screen**
- **File:** `src/screens/PlanCreationScreen.tsx`
- Enter plan name and description
- Select difficulty level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Browse exercise library with search
- Filter by category (Chest, Back, Legs, Shoulders, Arms, Core, Cardio)
- Add/remove exercises with tap
- Visual feedback for selected exercises
- Auto-calculate estimated time

### ✅ **Enhanced Active Workout Screen**
- **Updated:** `src/screens/ActiveWorkoutScreen.tsx`
- Now tracks all workout data:
  - Exercise completion status
  - Set-by-set tracking
  - Skip tracking
  - Timestamps
  - Total volume calculation
- Passes complete workout session to summary

### ✅ **Enhanced Dashboard**
- **Updated:** `src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`
- Navigation buttons for Plans and History
- Shows recent workout stats
- Uses context for data
- Dynamic plan selection

## Data Persistence

All data is now automatically saved to localStorage:
- ✅ Workout plans (create, edit, delete)
- ✅ Workout history (complete sessions with all details)
- ✅ User preferences (mode, weight units, etc.)
- ✅ Last used plan ID

## How to Test

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   cd prototype
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test flow:**
   - Go through onboarding (Welcome → Mode Selection)
   - Dashboard: Browse plans, view history button
   - Tap "📋 Plans" to manage workout plans
   - Create a new plan: select exercises, save
   - Start a workout: Adjust time in pre-flight → Start
   - Complete sets, skip exercises, use pause (Challenge Mode)
   - View summary with stats and badges
   - Check history to see saved workouts
   - Tap on past workouts to see details

3. **Data persistence:**
   - Refresh the page - your plans and history persist!
   - Last selected plan is remembered
   - Mode preference saved

## Technical Improvements

1. **Clean separation of concerns:**
   - Services for data
   - Context for state
   - Screens for UI
   - Clear data flow

2. **Type safety:**
   - All interfaces properly typed
   - TypeScript throughout
   - No `any` types

3. **Performance:**
   - Lazy state updates
   - Efficient re-renders
   - localStorage caching

4. **Code quality:**
   - Consistent patterns
   - Reusable components
   - Clear naming conventions

## What's Still Missing (Lower Priority)

- Settings/preferences UI
- Stagnation detection algorithm
- Level-up recommendation system
- Exercise drag-and-drop reordering
- Custom exercise form
- Export/import functionality
- Firebase sync (backend)
- Social features
- Advanced analytics

## Estimated Completion

**Before:** ~30% of MVP
**Now:** ~70% of MVP

All core workout flow features are complete and functional!
