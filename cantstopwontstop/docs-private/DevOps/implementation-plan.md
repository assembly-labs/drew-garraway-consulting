### Implementation Steps for Exercise Library

1. **Create the JSON file:**
   - Place in `/src/data/exerciseLibrary.json`
   - Populate with wishlist exercises
   - Validate JSON structure

2. **Build Exercise Service:**
   ```javascript
   // src/services/ExerciseService.js
   import exerciseData from '../data/exerciseLibrary.json';
   
   export const ExerciseService = {
     getAllExercises: () => exerciseData.exercises,
     
     getByCategory: (category) => 
       exerciseData.exercises.filter(ex => ex.category === category),
     
     searchExercises: (query) =>
       exerciseData.exercises.filter(ex =>
         ex.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
       ),
     
     getById: (id) =>
       exerciseData.exercises.find(ex => ex.id === id),
     
     getCategories: () => Object.keys(exerciseData.metadata.categories)
   };
   ```

3. **Custom Exercise Extension:**
   - Allow users to add custom exercises
   - Store in separate AsyncStorage key
   - Merge with pre-loaded library when displaying
   - Custom exercises get `custom: true` flag

4. **Exercise Updates:**
   - Version control in metadata
   - Migration strategy for schema changes
   - Ability to refresh library from server (future)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Timer drift over long workouts | High | Use Date.now() comparison, not just setInterval counting |
| App crashes during workout | Critical | Auto-save workout state every 30 seconds |
| Firebase sync conflicts | Medium | Implement last-write-wins with timestamps |
| Battery drain from wake lock | Medium | Optimize, allow dimming during rest |
| Slow exercise library search | Low | Pre-index exercises, use memoization |

### Product Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Users find tone too aggressive | Medium | Beta test messaging, allow customization |
| Pause limit too restrictive | Medium | Start with 3, iterate based on feedback |
| Exercise library incomplete | Low | Gather user requests, update in patches |
| Stagnation detection false positives | Low | Require 3+ consistent workouts before alerting |

2. Implementation + tests
3. Self-review
4. PR with description
5. Code review (1+ approval)
6. Merge to develop
7. QA testing
8. Merge to main for release

### Release Process
1. Feature freeze 1 week before release
2. Create release branch
3. QA regression testing
4. Bug fixes only
5. Build release candidates
6. Beta testing
7. Final approval
8. Deploy to app stores
9. Tag release in Git

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building "Can't Stop Won't Stop" from scratch to MVP launch in 8-10 weeks. The phased approach ensures foundational elements (data models, exercise library) are solid before building user-facing features.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Exercise library quality** - Well-structured, comprehensive exercise data
2. **Timer reliability** - Accurate, robust countdown mechanism
3. **Smooth UX** - Fast, responsive, minimal friction
4. **Data persistence** - Never lose user data
5. **Motivational tone** - Aggressive but supportive messaging

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Assemble development team
3. Setup development environment (Sprint 0)
4. Begin Sprint 1 with exercise content library creation
5. Weekly sprint reviews and adjustments
