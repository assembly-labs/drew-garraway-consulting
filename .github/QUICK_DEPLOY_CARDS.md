## ‚ö° Speed Tips

**Deploy multiple prototypes faster:**

1. Open 5 browser tabs (one per prototype)
2. Create all sites in parallel (Step 1)
3. Configure all in parallel (Step 2-3)
4. Deploy all (Step 4)
5. Rename all while deployments run (Step 5)

**Estimated time:**
- Per prototype: ~10 minutes
- All 4 remaining: ~40 minutes sequential, ~20 minutes parallel

## üîë Key Learnings

### What Works (PROVEN):
‚úÖ `cd <folder> && npm install && npm run build` pattern
‚úÖ Full paths for Publish directory: `<folder>/dist`
‚úÖ Full paths for Functions: `<folder>/netlify/functions`
‚úÖ Leave Base directory EMPTY
‚úÖ Ignore Package directory (empty or locked)

### What Doesn't Work:
‚ùå Using Base directory alone
‚ùå Using Package directory alone
‚ùå Relative paths when Package directory is set
‚ùå Expecting Package directory to change working dir
