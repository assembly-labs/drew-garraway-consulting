## Understanding the Setup

### What We Have

**Monorepo Structure:**
```
drew-garraway-consulting/
├── librarian-llm/          → Prototype 1
├── cantstopwontstop/       → Prototype 2
├── nofomo/                 → Prototype 3
├── assembly-agentic-articles/ → Prototype 4
└── gym/prototype/          → Prototype 5
```

**Deployment Strategy:**
- ✅ **ONE GitHub repository** containing all prototypes
- ✅ **FIVE separate Netlify sites** (one per prototype)
- ✅ **Each site points to SAME repo** but different subdirectory
- ✅ **Each site gets unique URL:** `prototype-name.netlify.app`

---

## Critical Configuration Rules

### 🚨 RULE 1: Use "cd" Approach for Monorepos

**✅ PROVEN WORKING METHOD (Tested with Librarian LLM):**

Netlify may auto-detect Package directory and lock it. When this happens:
- Package directory gets locked (cannot be cleared)
- **Solution:** Use `cd` command to navigate into folder
- Build command handles the directory change

**Working Pattern:**
```bash
Build command: cd <prototype-folder> && npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: <prototype-folder>/dist
```

---

### 🚨 RULE 2: No Root netlify.toml Files

**Why:**
- Root `netlify.toml` files cause **override warnings**
- They apply to **ALL sites**, not just one prototype
- Creates **configuration conflicts**

**Solution:**
- ✅ **DELETE** any root `netlify.toml` files
- ✅ Each prototype configures via **Netlify UI only**
- ✅ Config is set per-site, not shared

---

### 🚨 RULE 3: Path Structure for Monorepo

**✅ CORRECT (What Works):**

```
Base directory: (empty)
Package directory: (empty or locked - doesn't matter)
Build command: cd librarian-llm && npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: librarian-llm/dist
  ↓
Netlify behavior:
1. Starts at: /opt/build/repo/ (root)
2. Runs: cd librarian-llm (enters folder)
3. Runs: npm install && npm run build (in that folder)
4. Publishes: /opt/build/repo/librarian-llm/dist ✅
```

**❌ WRONG (What Doesn't Work):**

```
Base directory: librarian-llm
Package directory: librarian-llm/
  ↓
Result: Package directory doesn't change working directory
Build fails: Cannot find package.json at root
```

---

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Prerequisites (ONE TIME ONLY)

#### ✅ Step 1.1: Clean Git Repository

**Ensure node_modules are NOT tracked:**

```bash
cd /Users/drewgarraway/Documents/GitHub/drew-garraway-consulting

# Check if node_modules are tracked
git ls-files | grep "node_modules/" | wc -l

# If number is > 0, run cleanup script
bash scripts/cleanup-git-repo.sh

# Commit and push
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "🧹 Clean repository"
git push origin main
```

#### ✅ Step 1.2: Remove Root netlify.toml

```bash
# Check for root netlify.toml
ls -la netlify.toml*

# If exists, delete it
rm netlify.toml

# Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove root netlify.toml for monorepo setup"
git push origin main
```

---

### Phase 2: Create Netlify Site (REPEAT FOR EACH PROTOTYPE)

#### ✅ Step 2.1: Create New Site

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com**
2. Click: **Add new site**
3. Select: **Import an existing project**
4. Choose: **Deploy with GitHub**
5. Search and select: `drew-garraway-consulting`
6. ⚠️ **DO NOT** fill in build settings yet
7. Scroll to bottom, click: **Deploy site**

**Why deploy without settings?**
- Netlify needs to analyze the repo first
- It auto-detects Package directory during first deploy
- First deploy WILL FAIL - that's expected ✅

---

#### ✅ Step 2.2: Configure Build Settings (AFTER FIRST DEPLOY)

1. After first deploy fails, go to: **Site configuration** → **Build & deploy** → **Build settings**
2. Click: **Edit settings**
3. Fill in settings (see template below)
4. Click: **Save**
5. Go to: **Deploys** → **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

---

#### ✅ Step 2.3: Add Environment Variables

1. Go to: **Site configuration** → **Environment variables**
2. Click: **Add a variable**
3. Add required API keys (see prototype-specific section below)
4. Click: **Save**
5. Trigger new deploy to apply variables

---

#### ✅ Step 2.4: Rename Site URL

1. Go to: **Site configuration** → **Site details**
2. Under "Site information", click: **Change site name**
3. Enter new name (e.g., `librarian-llm`)
4. Click: **Save**
5. Site is now: `https://librarian-llm.netlify.app`

---

## Settings Template

### 🔵 TEMPLATE: Copy-Paste Settings for Each Prototype

**✅ PROVEN WORKING TEMPLATE (Used for Librarian LLM - SUCCESS):**

```
Base directory: (leave completely empty)

Package directory: (leave empty or ignore if locked)

Build command: cd <PROTOTYPE-FOLDER> && npm install && npm run build

Publish directory: <PROTOTYPE-FOLDER>/dist

Functions directory: <PROTOTYPE-FOLDER>/netlify/functions
(or leave empty if no functions)
```

**Example for librarian-llm:**
```
Base directory: (empty)
Package directory: (empty or locked - doesn't matter)
Build command: cd librarian-llm && npm install && npm run build
Publish directory: librarian-llm/dist
Functions directory: librarian-llm/netlify/functions
```

```

**Environment Variables:**
```
(Add any required API keys - check package.json for API usage)
```

**Proposed Site Name:** `gym-prototype`
**Target URL:** `https://gym-prototype.netlify.app`

---

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Issue: "Overridden by netlify.toml" Warning

**Cause:** Root `netlify.toml` file still exists in repo

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete root netlify.toml
rm netlify.toml
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove root netlify.toml"
git push origin main

# Refresh Netlify settings page
# Warning should disappear
```

---

### ❌ Issue: Build Fails - "Cannot find package.json"

**Cause:** Base directory or Package directory not set correctly

**Solution:**
- ✅ Ensure **Base directory is EMPTY**
- ✅ Ensure **Package directory = `prototype-folder/`**
- ✅ Path should point to where `package.json` exists

---

### ❌ Issue: Build Succeeds But Site Shows 404

**Cause:** Publish directory incorrect

**Solution:**
- ✅ Check where build outputs: `npm run build` creates `dist/` or `build/`?
- ✅ Set **Publish directory** to match (usually `dist`)
- ✅ Path is RELATIVE to Package directory

---

### ❌ Issue: Package Directory Won't Clear

**Cause:** Netlify auto-detected monorepo structure (this is NORMAL)

**Solution:**
- ✅ **Don't fight it!** Leave Package directory as-is
- ✅ Ensure Base directory is EMPTY
- ✅ Use the settings template above

---

### ❌ Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Cause:** Variables not prefixed correctly or not redeployed

**Solution:**
- ✅ For Vite apps: Variables MUST start with `VITE_`
- ✅ For Create React App: Variables MUST start with `REACT_APP_`
- ✅ After adding variables, **trigger new deploy**

---

## Quick Reference Checklist

### ✅ For Each New Prototype:

- [ ] Repository is clean (no node_modules tracked)
- [ ] No root `netlify.toml` file exists
- [ ] Created new Netlify site
- [ ] Configured build settings (Package directory approach)
- [ ] Added environment variables
- [ ] First deploy succeeded
- [ ] Renamed site URL
- [ ] Tested site loads correctly
- [ ] Documented URL in `DEPLOYED_SITES.md`

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What We Learned (The Hard Way)

1. **Netlify auto-detects monorepos** and forces Package directory
2. **Never use both** Base directory AND Package directory together
3. **Delete root netlify.toml** files to avoid override conflicts
4. **All paths are relative** to Package directory (not repo root)
5. **First deploy can fail** - that's okay, configure settings after

### What Works

✅ **Package directory approach** (monorepo-aware)
✅ **Separate Netlify sites** for each prototype
✅ **Configure via UI only** (no netlify.toml)
✅ **Environment variables per site** (isolated)

### What Doesn't Work

❌ Root netlify.toml with base directory
❌ Using Base directory + Package directory together
❌ Sharing one Netlify site for multiple prototypes
❌ Trying to clear locked Package directory field
