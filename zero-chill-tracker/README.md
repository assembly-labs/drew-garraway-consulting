A simple, beautiful web app for tracking your daily chill vs no-chill days. Press the button only if today had ZERO CHILL.

## UX Flow

1. **Daily Check-In**: Open the app to see the giant "ZERO CHILL" button
2. **Press Button**: If you had zero chill today, press the red button â†’ day marked as 0
3. **Alternative**: Press "Actually, it was chill ðŸ¤™" â†’ day marked as chill
4. **Confirmation**: See your choice confirmed with animation
5. **View History**: Navigate to calendar to see your monthly progress
6. **Stats Dashboard**: Check your chill percentage and streaks

## UX Design Decisions

1. **Focus on Daily Interaction**: The main screen is optimized for quick daily logging
2. **Giant Button**: Impossible to miss, makes the primary action obvious
3. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate confirmation with smooth animations
4. **Secondary Calendar**: History view doesn't interfere with daily check-in
5. **PWA**: Feels like a native app with offline support
6. **Persistent Data**: Never lose your tracking data

## How It Works

The app uses a custom `useChillTracker` hook that:
- Manages state for all tracked days
- Persists data to localStorage automatically
- Provides setDay() for direct value setting
- Calculates monthly statistics

Each day can be in one of two states:
- `1`: Chill day (green with ðŸ¤™)
- `0`: No chill day (red with 0)

The daily check-in makes it easy to track in under 5 seconds!
