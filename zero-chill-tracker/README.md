## UX Design Decisions

1. **One-Click Interaction**: Click to cycle through all states, making tracking effortless
2. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate color changes and smooth animations provide clear feedback
3. **Monthly Stats**: Quick overview of your month at a glance
4. **Today Highlight**: Current day has a blue border for easy identification
5. **Month Navigation**: Easy navigation with prev/next buttons and "Today" shortcut
6. **Responsive Grid**: Calendar adapts beautifully to any screen size

## How It Works

The app uses a custom `useChillTracker` hook that:
- Manages state for all tracked days
- Persists data to localStorage automatically
- Provides helpers for toggling days and calculating stats

Each day can be in one of three states:
- `null`: Not tracked (default)
- `1`: Chill day (green with ðŸ¤™)
- `0`: No chill day (red with 0)

Click any day to cycle through these states!
