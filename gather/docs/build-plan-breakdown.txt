GATHER MARKETPLACE — BUILD PLAN BREAKDOWN
Prepared for: Drew Garraway (Product Manager)

Date: February 16, 2026

================================================================================
1. WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT?
================================================================================

The build plan is a cost/effort estimate for building Gather — a farmers market
consumer marketplace. Think "Instacart for your local farmers market." It was
created by running a technical PRD (~180 features across 11 domains) through
multiple AI models for cost estimation, then manually adjusting those estimates
downward based on the reality that you (Drew) are a senior full-stack dev using
AI coding tools in 2026, not a 2023-era team.

The plan covers:
  - A lean MVP scoped to a single pilot market (Berwyn, PA)
  - A 24-month roadmap to scale beyond the pilot
  - Architecture decisions
  - Risk assessment
  - Build order (week-by-week)

================================================================================
2. THE TWO ESTIMATES — AND WHY THEY DIFFER
================================================================================

ORIGINAL ESTIMATE (6-model AI consensus):
  MVP: $120K–$170K | 1,100–1,400 hours | 5–7 months | Solo dev + 4 contractors

LEAN ESTIMATE (this plan):
  MVP: $31K–$44K  | 250–350 hours     | 8–12 weeks | Solo dev only

The original was ~3–4x higher because:
  - It assumed 2023 manual development speed (no AI acceleration)
  - It budgeted $18–33K for specialist contractors you don't need
  - It over-engineered for production SaaS (WCAG audits, Redis, WebSockets)
  - It didn't account for shadcn/ui eliminating most UI design work
  - It didn't account for AI generating 50–60% of CRUD/boilerplate code

The lean estimate is calibrated for "prove the product at one market" not
"launch a polished SaaS platform." That's the right call for a pilot.

================================================================================
3. PILOT SCOPE — WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S CUT
================================================================================

WHAT'S IN (MVP):
  - Full storefront: browse products, filter, search, product detail pages
  - Multi-vendor cart with stock validation
  - Checkout with Stripe card payments + multi-vendor payment splits
  - Order confirmation with QR code + email receipt
  - Staff dashboard: order management, status tracking, pack checklists
  - Pick list generation + print-ready formatting
  - QR check-in at market for order pickup
  - Issue resolution: mark items unavailable, process refunds
  - Vendor payouts via Stripe Connect
  - Admin product management (CRUD + image upload)
  - Admin market configuration (pickup slots, cutoff times)

WHAT'S CUT (deferred to Phase 2+):
  - Apple Pay / Google Pay (adds ~4h later)
  - Real-time dashboard updates (WebSockets)
  - Substitution flows (refund-only for now)
  - Server-side PDF pick lists (browser print for now)
  - Custom vendor payout dashboard (use Stripe's built-in)
  - Calendar integration / .ics download
  - WCAG AA formal audit (use semantic HTML + basic a11y)
  - Lighthouse performance tuning
  - Bulk order actions in staff dashboard
  - Redis for inventory locking (Postgres row-level locks are fine for <1K orders/day)

PM TAKEAWAY: Every cut is justified by pilot volume. You're serving one market
with <100 Saturday orders. The cuts remove complexity without degrading the
customer experience at that scale.

================================================================================
4. WHERE THE HOURS GO
================================================================================

The 250–350 hours break down into four buckets:

  Payments (Stripe) ........... 80–112h  (33%)  <-- The hard part
  Frontend / UI ............... 86–124h  (35%)  <-- AI-accelerated
  Admin / CRUD ................ 30–43h   (12%)  <-- Mostly AI-generated
  Foundation + QA ............. 49–71h   (20%)  <-- Setup + testing

DOMAIN-BY-DOMAIN:

  Foundation (schema, auth, deploy, design)     25–35h
  D1:  Storefront (browse, search, filters)     25–35h
  D2:  Cart (multi-vendor, stock validation)    12–18h
  D3:  Checkout (Stripe, payment splits)        35–50h  ** highest single domain
  D4:  Confirmation (QR code, email, lookup)     8–12h
  D5:  Staff Dashboard (orders, status, pack)   25–35h
  D6:  Pick Lists (generate + print CSS)        12–18h
  D7:  Check-in (QR scanner + manual fallback)  12–18h
  D8:  Issue Resolution (refunds, deductions)   15–22h
  D9:  Admin Products (CRUD + image upload)     20–28h
  D10: Admin Config (slots, cutoffs, roles)     10–15h
  D11: Payments (Connect, payouts, chargebacks) 30–40h
  QA + Polish                                   15–25h

PM TAKEAWAY: One-third of the entire build is payments (D3 + D8 + D11). This
is the technical risk center. Everything else is standard Next.js/React work
that AI tools handle efficiently. If anything is going to blow the timeline,
it will be Stripe edge cases.

================================================================================
5. BUILD ORDER (WEEK-BY-WEEK)
================================================================================

WEEKS 1–2: Foundation + Admin
  - Database schema, auth (Clerk), deployment (Vercel), design system (shadcn)
  - Admin product CRUD + image upload
  - Admin market config + pickup slots
  WHY FIRST: Everything else depends on having data and auth in place.

WEEKS 3–4: Payments + Checkout
  - Stripe Connect vendor onboarding
  - Checkout page with payment form
  - Multi-vendor payment splits
  - Webhooks (payment success, refunds)
  - Order confirmation + QR code + email
  WHY SECOND: Payments are the riskiest domain. Tackle early so problems
  surface with time to fix them.

WEEKS 5–7: Storefront + Cart
  - Homepage, product grid, filters, search
  - Product detail + vendor pages
  - Multi-vendor cart with localStorage
  - Stock validation + cutoff enforcement
  - Guest order lookup
  WHY THIRD: Now that checkout works, build the shopping experience on top.

WEEKS 8–10: Staff Operations
  - Staff dashboard (order table, status workflow, pack checklists)
  - Pick list generator + print formatting
  - QR check-in scanner
  - Issue resolution (unavailable items, refunds)
  WHY FOURTH: Operations tooling that market staff need on launch day.

WEEKS 11–12: Payouts + Ship
  - Vendor payout scheduling
  - Chargeback handling
  - Mobile testing + bug fixes
  - Dry run with market staff
  - LAUNCH AT BERWYN
  WHY LAST: Polish, test with real hardware (printers, tablets), and go live.

PM TAKEAWAY: The build order front-loads risk. Payments first, UI second,
operations third. This means if you need to cut scope mid-build, you cut from
the operational polish (weeks 8–10), not from the payment plumbing.

================================================================================
6. COST SUMMARY
================================================================================

MVP (PILOT):
  Hours:        250–350 (point estimate: ~300)
  Timeline:     8–10 weeks @ 35h/week
                10–14 weeks @ 25h/week (if also running the business)
  Cost:         $31K–$44K (opportunity cost @ $125/hr)
  Hard costs:   ~$20–100/month (hosting, services)
  Stripe fees:  2.9% + $0.30/transaction (passed to customer or absorbed)

24-MONTH ROADMAP:
  Phase 1 (Mo 1–3):   MVP pilot ..................... $31–44K
  Phase 2 (Mo 4–9):   Vendor portal + multi-market .. $44–63K
  Phase 3 (Mo 10–15): Market mgmt SaaS + EBT ........ $63–100K
  Phase 4 (Mo 16–24): Native apps + ecosystem ........ $75–125K
  TOTAL 24-MONTH:     ~$275K (point estimate)

INVESTOR FRAMING:
  MVP dev (your time): ~$38K opportunity cost at market rate
  Full 24-month:       ~$275K opportunity cost
  Revenue target:      $50K GMV first season, $250K ARR by Year 1 (100 markets)

================================================================================
7. TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS
================================================================================

These are locked in for the MVP:

  Framework:      Next.js (App Router) — SSR, API routes, image optimization
  UI:             shadcn/ui — pre-built components, brand = CSS variables only
  Database:       Vercel Postgres (consider Supabase later for Realtime)
  Auth:           Clerk (fastest to implement, free tier)
  Payments:       Stripe Connect (Separate Charges + Transfers for multi-vendor)
  Images:         Cloudflare R2 (free egress)
  Email:          Resend (transactional)
  Deployment:     Vercel
  Merchant model: Platform is Merchant of Record (Stripe Radar enabled)

PM TAKEAWAY: This is a well-proven stack with no exotic choices. Every piece
has extensive documentation and AI training data, which maximizes AI-assisted
development speed.

================================================================================
8. RISKS
================================================================================

  RISK                                    LIKELIHOOD    MITIGATION
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Stripe split payment edge cases         Medium        Test extensively in sandbox;
                                                        start single-vendor, add
                                                        splits in week 3

  Pick lists look bad when printed        Medium        Test on actual market printer
                                                        by week 8

  QR scanner flaky on cheap tablets       Low-Medium    html5-qrcode is mature; test
                                                        on target device early

  70-vendor data entry is slow            High          Build CSV import (~4h); get
                                                        vendor data early

  Solo dev burnout                        Low           10–12 week sprint is
                                                        manageable

PM TAKEAWAY: The highest-likelihood risk is data entry, not code. Getting
vendor data (names, products, photos, prices) for 70 vendors / 500 products
is a real blocker that takes time regardless of code speed. Start collecting
vendor data NOW, in parallel with development.

================================================================================
9. OPEN QUESTIONS (DECISIONS NEEDED BEFORE CODING)
================================================================================

These are product/business decisions that must be made before development:

  1. VENDOR DATA: Do you have vendor data ready (names, products, photos,
     prices)? If not, this is a blocker. Plan a CSV import tool and start
     collecting data immediately.

  2. TARGET LAUNCH DATE: When does Berwyn market season open? Work backward
     from that date to set the development start.

  3. COMMISSION MODEL: 2.5% vs 8% — this is just a config value in code,
     but the business decision affects vendor onboarding conversations.

  4. PACKING MODEL: Do vendors pre-pack orders, or does market staff collect
     items from vendor stalls? This affects pick list design.

  5. PICKUP LOGISTICS: Centralized pickup tent, or customers go to each
     vendor? This affects the check-in flow design.

================================================================================
10. PM RECOMMENDATIONS / NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

  1. ANSWER THE 5 OPEN QUESTIONS above — these are your immediate action items.
     Development cannot start meaningfully until #1 (vendor data), #4 (packing
     model), and #5 (pickup logistics) are decided.

  2. START VENDOR DATA COLLECTION NOW — even before code starts. Build a
     simple spreadsheet template and start getting vendors to fill it in.
     This is the most likely timeline blocker.

  3. LOCK THE LAUNCH DATE — back-calculate from Berwyn market opening.
     If market opens in May/June, you need to start coding by March at the
     latest (at 25h/week pace).

  4. ACCEPT THE SCOPE CUTS — every item in the "cut" list is justified for
     a pilot. Resist the urge to add Apple Pay, WebSockets, or substitution
     flows before proving the core experience works.

  5. FRONT-LOAD PAYMENT TESTING — the build plan already does this (weeks
     3–4). Hold firm on this sequencing. Do not get pulled into "let me just
     finish the storefront first" — payments are where surprises live.

  6. PLAN A DRY RUN — schedule a mock market day with staff before the real
     launch. Test printers, tablets, QR scanning, and the full order flow
     end-to-end with real hardware.

  7. BUDGET FOR EBT AS THE BIG UNKNOWN — Phase 3 includes SNAP/EBT support,
     which could add $30–50K if compliance is complex. Track Forage (EBT
     payment processor) developments and factor this into fundraising
     conversations.
