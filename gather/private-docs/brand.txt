Gather
Good things from good people
Our Philosophy
You know what's beautiful? When neighbors take care of each other. When you buy carrots from someone whose kids go to school with yours. When you know exactly where your food comes from—not some factory, but Sarah's farm down the road. That's real. That's good. And that's worth protecting.
We believe you deserve to know what's in your food and who grew it. No mystery ingredients. No corporate shareholders. Just good people making good things for their neighbors.

What We Stand For
You're special just the way you are  Every farmer, every maker, every person at market—you matter. Your craft matters. Your choice to shop local matters.
Neighbors taking care of neighbors The best rebellion? Choosing each other over corporations. It's quiet, it's powerful, and it's happening every weekend at the market.
Knowing is caring  When you know who grew your tomatoes, you know they're not covered in stuff that hurts our streams. When you know who baked your bread, you know what's actually in it. That's how it should be.
The gentle revolution  We don't need to shout. Every time someone chooses the farmer down the road over the supermarket chain, that's the revolution. Quiet, steady, powerful.

Our Voice
We sound like:
	•	Mr. Rogers with a farmers market booth
	•	Your neighbor who grows their own food and shares the extras
	•	Someone who chose community over convenience
	•	A friend who knows corporate food is weird and local food is normal
The undertone:
We're polite rebels. We're not angry—we're just not participating in systems that hurt our neighbors and our land. We're building something better, one tomato at a time.

Core Messages
Primary:
"Creating good things, with great ingredients.”
Supporting truths:
	•	"You don't need a corporation between you and your carrots"
	•	"Real food from real neighbors"
	•	"Taking care of each other is the most radical thing we can do"
	•	"Good things don't need 37 ingredients"
Our quiet rebellion:
"Every purchase at market is a vote for neighbors over corporations, for clean water over runoff, for knowing what you're eating over mystery ingredients. That's not radical. That's just sensible."

Talking to Our Neighbors
To Market Managers
You're the neighborhood helper
"You know what? You're doing something special. You're creating a place where neighbors take care of each other without any corporation in the middle. That's beautiful. Let us handle the paperwork so you can keep building this good thing."
Key messages:
	•	"You're helping neighbors take care of each other"
	•	"Building something corporations can't buy"
	•	"Making space for real food and real people"
	•	"You make the neighborhood better"

To Farmers & Makers
You're the real deal
"You could have chosen the easy path—wholesale to big chains, mysterious ingredients, cutting corners. But you didn't. You chose to make good things the right way for your neighbors. We're here to make that choice easier."
Key messages:
	•	"You're feeding neighbors, not shareholders"
	•	"Your good work deserves good support"
	•	"No middlemen, no nonsense, just neighbors"
	•	"Made with care beats made with chemicals"
The truth we share: "You know what's in your soil. You know what's in your products. Your neighbors deserve to know too. That's not fancy marketing—that's just being a good neighbor."

To Shoppers
You're making the neighborhood better
"Hi neighbor. When you choose to Gather from local folks, you're doing something kind of amazing. You're saying no to food that traveled 1,500 miles and yes to food from 5 miles away. You're choosing to know who made your dinner. That's special."
Key messages:
	•	"You deserve to know who grew your food"
	•	"Supporting neighbors, not corporations"
	•	"Good food doesn't need mystery ingredients"
	•	"Every purchase is a small act of rebellion (the gentle kind)"
What we believe about you: "You're the kind of person who cares where things come from. Who thinks it's weird that corporations own our food. Who'd rather support the family farm than the factory farm. You're good people."

The Gentle Rebellion
We're quietly fighting:
	•	Food that needs a chemistry degree to understand
	•	Vegetables that poison waterways
	•	Corporations that pretend to be local
	•	Systems that make farmers broke and CEOs rich
	•	The idea that cheap is more important than clean
But we say it gently:
	•	"Food with ingredients you can pronounce"
	•	"Grown in ways that help our water stay clean"
	•	"Actually local, not 'locally sourced'"
	•	"Where farmers earn fair prices"
	•	"Good things cost what they cost"

Mr. Rogers Meets Punk Rock
Rogers-style warmth:
	•	"You've made this day a special day just by being you"
	•	"It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood—especially at market"
	•	"I like you just the way you are—no corporate optimization needed"
	•	"Won't you be my neighbor? The kind who shops local?"
With subtle rebellion:
	•	"You know what? It's okay to not trust corporations with your food"
	•	"Choosing neighbors over chains is a beautiful thing"
	•	"You don't need anyone's permission to opt out of industrial food"
	•	"The most punk rock thing you can do? Know your farmer"

Community Stories
Farmer spotlight: "Meet Tom. He grows tomatoes without stuff that hurts the creek behind his farm. His kids swim there. So do yours. That's why he grows things the right way. Good guy, good tomatoes, good neighbor."
Market story: "Every Saturday, 40 neighbors set up booths instead of selling to corporations. It's a small revolution. A gentle one. The kind Mr. Rogers would appreciate."

Handling Questions
"Is this anti-corporate?" "We're not anti-anything. We're pro-neighbor. Pro-knowing where your food comes from. Pro-supporting people over shareholders."
"Sounds political" "Choosing to support your neighbors isn't political. It's just being a good neighbor."
"Why does local matter?" "Because you deserve to know what's in your food. Because money should stay in our community. Because Tom's tomatoes shouldn't travel 1,500 miles when Tom lives 5 miles away."
