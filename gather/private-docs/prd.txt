Gather: Market Management & Marketplace Platform
 
Executive Summary
Gather is a comprehensive SaaS platform that solves the administrative nightmare facing 8,140 US farmers markets. Market managers currently spend 40-60 hours per week on manual vendor management, payment processing, and compliance reporting. Our platform automates these workflows while enabling a full marketplace for online pre-orders with an Instacart-like shopping experience, unlocking new revenue streams for markets, vendors, and the platform.
Problem Statement
Primary Problems (Market Managers)
	•	Vendor Management Chaos: Managing 30+ vendors via spreadsheets, paper applications, and "4-inch binders"
	•	Payment Processing Nightmare: SNAP/EBT requires manual token distribution and reconciliation, consuming 30-40% of manager time
	•	Grant Reporting Burden: Manual compilation of data for USDA FMPP/LFPP applications
	•	Fee Collection: Chasing vendors for booth fees, tracking overdue payments manually
	•	Communication Fragmentation: Information scattered across email, phone, text with frequent missed messages
	•	Product Catalog Chaos: No central system to track what products are available when
Secondary Problems (Vendors & Customers)
	•	Vendors: 30-45 day payment delays in wholesale channels, managing inventory across multiple sales channels, no easy way to reach customers online
	•	Customers: 51% cite "inconvenience" as barrier - limited hours, weather dependency, can't pre-order, don't know what's available
Solution Overview
Phase 1: Core Market Management (MVP - Months 1-6)
Essential features to capture market manager workflow and vendor/product management
Phase 2: Marketplace Integration (Months 7-12)
Full Instacart-like shopping experience based on Berwyn model validation
