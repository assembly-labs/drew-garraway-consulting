My great-grandfather bought our farm in 1923. Back then, he sold everything from a roadside stand—vegetables, eggs, whatever was in season.

By the time I took over, that world had changed. Industrial agriculture. Supermarket consolidation. Rising land costs. Our little farm couldn't compete on volume or price.

The farmers market gave us a different way to compete: on quality and relationships.

At the market, people want to know where their food comes from. They want to shake the hand of the person who grew it. They want heirloom tomatoes with actual flavor, not varieties bred to survive shipping.

Now my daughter is learning the business. She handles our social media—something I still don't fully understand—and has ideas about adding agritourism. The markets gave us a viable path forward, and she'll carry that into the next generation.

A hundred years of growing. The methods have changed, but the mission hasn't: feeding our neighbors with food we're proud to grow.
