## Our Mission

Locally Strong is dedicated to strengthening local communities by empowering small businesses, farmers, and producers. Through collaboration, education, strategic partnerships, and thoughtful innovation, we create a thriving network that fosters growth, sustainability, and economic resilience.

Our mission is to amplify public awareness of the benefits of shopping locally, highlighting the positive impact on health, the environment, and the economy, while thoughtfully evolving traditional farmers markets to meet the needs of today's consumers.

Through community events, mentorship, fundraising initiatives, and innovative programs, we provide valuable resources that support and uplift small businesses—ensuring they have the tools to succeed both now and in the future.

## Our Values

**Community First**
Every decision we make centers on strengthening the communities we serve. We believe vibrant local economies create vibrant neighborhoods.

**Collaboration Over Competition**
We bring together vendors, farmers, organizations, and community members because we accomplish more together than any of us can alone.

**Accessible to All**
Local food and community commerce should be accessible to everyone. We work to break down barriers and expand access.

**Tradition Meets Innovation**
We honor the traditions that make farmers markets special while thoughtfully integrating innovations that help them thrive in modern times.

**Sustainable Growth**
We prioritize approaches that create lasting impact—environmentally, economically, and socially.
