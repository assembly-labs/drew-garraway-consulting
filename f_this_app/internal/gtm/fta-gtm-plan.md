## Tiered Launch Strategy: Zero to Low Budget

## Core Insight: The Game Night Wedge

The killer use case isn't "track your cursing all week." It's **"game night mode"** — friends physically together, guard down, competitive energy high, catching each other in the moment.

This solves three problems at once:
1. **Presence validation** — You're in the same room, no honor system needed
2. **Immediate gameplay** — Points stack up in real-time over 2-4 hours
3. **Natural virality** — "We played this thing last night, it was hilarious"

The long-range "weekly battle" mode can exist, but **game night is the wedge that gets people in the door.**

---

## Validation Mechanics (Keep It Simple)

### Primary Mode: In-Person Sessions
- Players are physically together
- Any player can tap to report another player's curse
- No validation needed — if you're in the room, you heard it
- Session runs for set time (2 hours, 4 hours, "until we're done")

### Secondary Mode: Extended Battles (Week-long)
- Players are remote/async
- Reporter taps when they witness a curse (call, video, in-person hangout)
- **Simple validation:** Reported player gets notified, can "Accept" or "Dispute"
- If disputed, stays pending — no complex arbitration for MVP
- Honor system with social pressure (your friends see if you dispute everything)

### Future Mode (Post-MVP): Witness Validation
- Third player can confirm or deny a disputed report
- Creates "referee" role without overcomplicating

**MVP keeps it simple: In-person sessions need no validation. Remote play uses accept/dispute with social transparency.**

---

## Tier 0: Zero Budget Launch

**Goal:** Get 50-100 active players validating the core loop before spending a dollar.

### Week 1-2: Inner Circle Beta

**Your Network**
- Personal friends and family willing to test
- Coffee & Code Philadelphia community
- BJJ gym crew (competitive people who probably curse)
- Your son's sports parent networks (families trying to curse less)

**The Ask:**
> "I'm building an app where friends compete to curse the least. It's like a digital swear jar but you battle each other. Can I get 4-6 of you to try it during your next game night/hangout? I need feedback."

**Target:** 3-5 friend groups actively playing sessions

### Week 3-4: Expand via Word of Mouth

**Game Night Seeding**
- Ask beta users: "Who else hosts game nights? Board game groups? Poker nights? D&D sessions?"
- Provide each beta group a simple invite mechanism
- Track: Do groups invite other groups organically?

**Content Creation (Free)**
- Record 60-second screen capture of gameplay
- Post to personal LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok
- Caption: "Built an app where my friends catch me cursing. Down 47 points. Send help."

**Reddit Seeding (Careful, No Spam)**
- r/boardgames — "Looking for playtesters: app that tracks who curses most during game night"
- r/DnD — "Our table added a curse penalty rule, made an app for it"
- r/daddit or r/Mommit — "Trying to curse less around the kids, built a competitive tracker"
- Engage genuinely, don't just drop links

**Local Community**
- Philly board game cafes (Thirsty Dice, etc.) — ask if they'd let you demo
- Offer to run a "clean mouth game night" event for free

### Metrics to Hit Before Spending Money
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active groups | 10+ |
| Sessions played | 50+ |
| Day 7 retention | 15%+ |
| Organic invites | Users inviting friends without prompting |
| Qualitative feedback | "This is fun" not "this is interesting" |

## Tier 1: Low Budget ($500-2,000)

**Goal:** Accelerate what's already working. Only spend once Tier 0 validates engagement.

### Paid Tactics

**1. Micro-Influencer Seeding ($200-500)**

Target: Small YouTubers/TikTokers who film game nights, tabletop sessions, friend hangouts

| Niche | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Board game reviewers | Already film group sessions, audience is your demo |
| D&D/TTRPG streamers | Chaotic energy, curse-prone, engaged communities |
| Family vloggers | "No cursing around kids" resonates |
| Poker/card game content | Competitive, social, exactly the vibe |

**The Offer:**
> "Free access + $50-100 if you feature it in one game night video. Just show the app running during your session, reactions to getting caught."

Authenticity > polish. You want real reactions, not scripted reviews.

**2. Targeted Social Ads ($300-500)**

Platform: **TikTok or Instagram Reels** (short-form, viral potential)

Creative Concept:
- Film actual gameplay footage from beta groups
- Montage of people getting caught cursing, reactions
- Text overlay: "The game where your friends snitch on your potty mouth"
- CTA: "Download free. Ruin your friendships."

Targeting:
- Interests: Board games, tabletop gaming, party games, Jackbox Games
- Age: 25-45
- Behaviors: App installers, game purchasers

**Budget Allocation:**
- $100 testing 3-4 creative variants
- $200-400 scaling winner

**3. Game Night Event Sponsorship ($200-300)**

Partner with local board game cafes or meetup groups:
- Sponsor a "Clean Mouth Game Night" — you cover snacks/drinks
- Every table plays with the app running
- Winner (lowest curse count) gets a small prize
- Collect emails, feedback, testimonials

**4. Referral Mechanics (Built into App, $0 marginal cost)**

- "Invite a friend, you both get a streak freeze"
- "Create a group of 6+, unlock exclusive badges"
- Leaderboards for "most active referrer"

### Content Strategy (Low Cost, High Leverage)

**Weekly Content Cadence:**
| Day | Content | Platform |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Monday | "Weekend curse count leaderboard" screenshot | Twitter, LinkedIn |
| Wednesday | User-submitted funny curse moment | TikTok, Reels |
| Friday | "Game night reminder" meme | Instagram Stories |

**Mascot Content:**
- Dirty Mouth character reacting to curse reports
- Clean Mouth celebrating streaks
- Simple static images with speech bubbles, no animation needed yet

**User-Generated Content Flywheel:**
- Encourage users to screenshot/screen-record their sessions
- Repost the best ones
- Create a hashtag: #MouthOff or #CurseCount

## Tier 1.5: Tabletop Gaming Niche Deep Dive ($500-1,000 additional)

If game night traction proves strong, double down on that niche specifically.

- Local game cons
- Demo tables, swag (stickers, coasters with QR codes)

**Game Store Partnerships**
- Offer stores a "Clean Mouth League" kit

## Success Indicators Before Scaling Further

### Green Lights (Ready for more investment)
