## Feature Evaluation Criteria

Every feature is evaluated against:

1. **Retention Impact** — Does it reduce churn or increase DAU?
2. **Virality** — Does it create shareable moments?
3. **Revenue Potential** — Can it be monetized?
4. **Dev Effort** — How long to build?
5. **Competitive Advantage** — Does it differentiate us?

## Adding New Features

1. Add to `roadmap.md` with full rationale
2. Evaluate against criteria above
3. Assign to appropriate phase
4. Create detailed spec when ready to build
