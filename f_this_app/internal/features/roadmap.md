## Feature Summaries

### 1. Achievement Badges
Unlock badges for specific accomplishments that display on profiles:
- **Clean Mouth Champion** — Won 3 games
- **Snitch King** — Filed 100 reports
- **Ironman** — 30-day clean streak
- **Nice Word Ninja** — Used nice word 50 times

**Why:** Low dev cost, high engagement return. Collection mechanics drive long-term retention.

---

### 2. Shareable Weekly Recaps
Generate branded image cards summarizing weekly performance:
- Your rank, curses, clean days, nice words
- Winner/loser callouts with mascot art
- Optimized for Instagram Stories, iMessage, Twitter

**Why:** Critical for organic growth. Every share spreads Sunny and Filthy Phil.

---

### 3. Streak Freeze & Recovery
Allow players to earn or purchase "streak freezes" that protect their clean streak from a single slip-up.

**Why:** Duolingo's data shows users are 2.3x more likely to engage daily once they have a 7-day streak. Breaking one causes rage-quits.

---

### 4. Consequence Contracts & Loser Dares
Before a game starts, players agree on consequences for the loser(s):
- Dye hair a color chosen by winner
- Wear ridiculous outfit to work
- Buy winner dinner/drinks
- Post embarrassing photo

**Why:** THE viral differentiator. "Truth or Dare meets habit tracking" — unique in the market.

---

### 5. Money Stakes
Pool real money into games. Lowest score wins the pot (minus platform fee).
- Alternative: Anti-charity mode (losers' stakes go to org they hate)

**Why:** Research shows financial stakes improve success by 300%. StepBet paid out $200M+.

---

### 6. Head-to-Head Quick Challenges
Challenge a single friend to a 24-hour or weekend curse-off:
- Both players agree to start time
- Lowest curse count wins
- Optional: small stakes ($5 to charity)

**Why:** Not everyone can commit to week-long games. Great for onboarding skeptical friends.

---

### 7. Curse Severity Tiers
Not all curses are equal:
- **Mild** (damn, hell, crap): +1 point
- **Moderate** (common curse words): +2 points
- **Nuclear** (the really bad ones): +3 points

**Why:** Reflects how people actually think about language. Adds strategy.

---

### 8. Dispute System
Allow reported players to dispute a curse report:
- Reporter provides context or witness
- Group voting or referee resolves disputes
- Failed challenges cost points

**Why:** Prevents trolling and false reporting in competitive games.

---

### 9. Compliment Mode (Out of Left Field)
Flip the entire concept. Track **compliments and positive affirmations**:
- Same mechanics, opposite scoring (more = better)
- Sunny becomes main character
- Corporate wellness, schools, therapy practices want this

**Why:** Doubles addressable market with minimal core changes.

---

### 10. Filthy Phil AI Coach (Out of Left Field)
Conversational AI that embodies Filthy Phil:
- Personalized roasts based on performance
- Tips on controlling language
- Motivational trash talk
- Voice mode for audio roasts

**Why:** No habit app has an AI coach with personality. Creates emotional connection.

---

### 11. Smart Watch Integration
Apple Watch and WearOS app for instant curse reporting:
- Complication on watch face showing game status
- Tap to report with quick player selector
- Haptic notification when reported

**Why:** Reporting needs to be INSTANT. Watch is faster than pulling out phone.

---
