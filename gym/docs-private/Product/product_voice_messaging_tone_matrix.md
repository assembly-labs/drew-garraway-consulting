## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
- Store voice as enum: `JOCKO`, `GOGGINS`, `ARNOLD`, `STALLONE`, `CHUCK`, `BRUCE_LEE`, `RENZO`, `RICKSON`, `DANAHER`
- Each notification includes `voice` parameter
- Chuck Norris should be randomized at <3% probability
- Settings should allow voice preference weighting
- Default distribution: Goggins 22%, Jocko 18%, Arnold 11%, Stallone 11%, Danaher 10%, Bruce Lee 9%, Renzo 9%, Rickson 7%, Chuck 3%

### Message Selection Logic
```
if (event == STAGNATION) {
  voice = weighted_random([GOGGINS: 40%, DANAHER: 25%, RENZO: 15%, JOCKO: 10%, BRUCE_LEE: 10%])
}
else if (event == PR) {
  voice = weighted_random([ARNOLD: 35%, GOGGINS: 20%, DANAHER: 15%, JOCKO: 15%, STALLONE: 10%, RENZO: 5%])
}
else if (event == FAILURE) {
  voice = weighted_random([STALLONE: 25%, GOGGINS: 20%, RICKSON: 20%, DANAHER: 15%, JOCKO: 10%, BRUCE_LEE: 10%])
}
else if (event == MID_WORKOUT_PUSH) {
  voice = weighted_random([GOGGINS: 30%, JOCKO: 25%, RENZO: 15%, ARNOLD: 12%, BRUCE_LEE: 10%, RICKSON: 5%, DANAHER: 3%])
  if (random(1-100) <= 3) voice = CHUCK  // Easter egg
}
else if (event == FORM_REMINDER) {
  voice = weighted_random([DANAHER: 35%, RICKSON: 25%, BRUCE_LEE: 20%, JOCKO: 15%, RENZO: 5%])
}
else if (event == REST_PERIOD) {
  voice = weighted_random([RICKSON: 35%, DANAHER: 25%, JOCKO: 20%, GOGGINS: 15%, BRUCE_LEE: 5%])
}
else if (event == CONSISTENCY_STREAK) {
  voice = weighted_random([JOCKO: 30%, GOGGINS: 25%, DANAHER: 20%, RENZO: 15%, RICKSON: 10%])
