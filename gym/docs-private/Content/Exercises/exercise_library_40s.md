### Progressive Overload Strategy
**Method:** Double Progression  
**Step 1:** Increase reps from 8 to 12 at given weight  
**Step 2:** Increase weight 2.5-5 lbs and return to 8 reps  
**Rules:**  
- Never increase weight more than 5 lbs at a time
- Never add more than 1 rep per set between weeks
**Rationale:** Gradual approach protects joints while ensuring consistent progress

## WARMUP REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### General Warmup (5 minutes)
Light cardio elevating body temperature and heart rate  
**Example:** Rowing at easy pace, light cycling, brisk walking

### Specific Warmup (5-10 minutes)
Movement-specific preparation with progressive loading  
**For Squats:** Bodyweight squats × 10, goblet squats × 10, progressive weight loading  
**For Pressing:** Push-ups × 10, empty bar × 10, progressive weight loading  
**For Deadlifts:** RDLs with light weight, hip hinges, progressive weight loading

**Critical Note:** Never skip warmups after age 40 - injuries take months to heal versus days when younger

## EXERCISE TECHNIQUE PRINCIPLES

### Full Range of Motion
Train muscles through complete ranges, emphasizing stretched position (bottom of squat, chest-to-bar on rows, deep stretch on RDLs)

### Eccentric Control
Lower weights over 2-3 seconds on all exercises. Eccentric strength critical for longevity (controlling descent when sitting, stairs, preventing falls)

### No Momentum
Strict form without bounce or swing. Controlled reps build muscle and protect joints.

### Neutral Spine
Maintain neutral spine position (neither excessively rounded nor arched) during all loaded movements to protect discs

### Progressive Quality
Focus on improving tempo, range of motion, mind-muscle connection, and form quality over just adding weight

## RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

### Daily Mobility Work (10-15 minutes)
Cat-cow, thread the needle, 90/90 hip stretch, wall angels every morning

### Sleep Optimization
Target 7-9 hours nightly - when muscle repair and growth occur

### Nutrition Fundamentals
**Protein:** 1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight daily (0.7-1g per pound)  
**Meals:** Spread across 3-4 meals  
**Calories:** Slight surplus (+200-300) if building muscle, maintenance if recomping

### Hydration
3-4 liters water daily - monitor urine color (should be pale yellow)

### Deload Weeks
Every 4-6 weeks, reduce volume by 50% for one full week. Maintain intensity but cut sets in half. Non-negotiable for men 40+.

## WHEN TO MODIFY OR SKIP TRAINING

### Joint Pain Lasting 3+ Days
Distinguish muscle soreness (productive) from joint pain (warning). If joints hurt, reduce load or take full week off.

### Declining Performance 2+ Consecutive Weeks
Sign of inadequate recovery. Take deload week immediately.

### Poor Sleep or High Stress
Consider skipping workout if truly exhausted or during major life stressors. One missed session prevents injury requiring weeks off.

### Illness
If truly sick (fever, body aches), skip training entirely. If mild cold, can do 50% session. Always ramp back up slowly over 3-7 days after illness.
