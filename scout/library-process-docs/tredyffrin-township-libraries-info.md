## About the Tredyffrin Township Libraries
The Tredyffrin Township Libraries consist of two library locations: Tredyffrin Public Library and Paoli Library. The Libraries are governed by a seven-member Board of Trustees appointed by the Tredyffrin Township Board of Supervisors. The Township provides 85% of the Libraries' funding, with the remaining 15% provided through state funding. Both libraries are members of the Chester County Library System (CCLS).
