Interlibrary Loan (ILL) is the service by which libraries borrow and lend materials in order to supplement their existing collections. ILL is not the same as the Holds service used between libraries in the Chester County Library System, but occurs between libraries across the nation.

ILL is available to patrons with a current library card from any of the 18 libraries in the Chester County Library System and whose records are updated and fine-free. Just fill out a request at your local library in person, by phone, or online.
