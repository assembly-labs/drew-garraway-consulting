# CLAIMS RETURNED

The CCLS Board of Trustees has instituted this policy to assist in recovering materials that have been returned according to the patron. This procedure does not imply that we disbelieve the patron, but rather serves to help recover materials that may be missing.

## Paying Library Fines and Fees
- Fines and fees can be paid at any of the CCLS member libraries.
- Items can be returned to any of the CCLS member libraries.
- Note: some libraries can no longer accept credit cards as payment. The cardholder library can advise the patron.

## CLAIMS RETURNED

The process of "claims returned" shall be used when a patron has indicated to the library that the material in question has been returned. There is a limit of two active claims returned items per patron. Once a patron has reached the limit of two items, they may not claim additional items until a previously claimed item has been resolved.

When a patron claims that an item has been returned, the library will:
- Search the shelf and surrounding areas
- Check the book drop
- Review recent check-ins
- Mark the item as "claims returned" in the system

If the item is not found within 90 days:
- The patron will be billed for the replacement cost
- The patron's borrowing privileges may be limited or suspended
- The matter may be referred to a collection agency if payment is not received

## NOTICES

The CCLS automated system generates several types of notices to keep patrons informed about their accounts:

### Courtesy Notices
Sent one day before items are due via email or text message to patrons who have opted in.

### Overdue Notices
- First overdue notice: 3 days after due date
- Second overdue notice: 10 days after due date
- Third overdue notice: 17 days after due date
- Final notice: 21 days after due date (sent via US mail with replacement costs)

### Hold Notices
Patrons are notified when requested materials are available for pickup. Items are held for 7 days before being passed to the next patron or returned to the shelf.

## LIBRARY MATERIAL HOLDS

Patrons in good standing may place holds on CCLS materials. The following guidelines apply:

- Patrons may have up to 25 active holds
- DVDs and new materials may have hold limits
- Museum passes cannot have holds placed on them
- Patrons will be notified when items are ready for pickup
- Items not picked up within 7 days will go to the next patron
- Holds can be suspended for vacation periods

## COLLECTION AGENCY

Accounts with materials 90+ days overdue or with fines exceeding $25.00 may be referred to a collection agency. Before referral:
- Multiple notices will be sent
- The patron will receive a final notice via certified mail
- Once referred to collections, a $10.00 fee is added to the account
- Full payment must be made to restore borrowing privileges
- The collection agency reports to credit bureaus
