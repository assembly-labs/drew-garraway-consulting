BRIEF 1: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
"What Competitors Do & Don't Do - Scout's Market Window"
================================================================================
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
There is NO production-ready LLM-powered discovery system for US public
libraries as of late 2024. This creates a 2-3 year market window before
major vendors consolidate AI features. Scout's opportunity is to establish
the category and become the default solution.


THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
-------------------------

TIER 1: DIRECT COMPETITORS (LLM-Powered Discovery)
None exist in production for public libraries.

    OverDrive "Inspire Me" (Launched August 2024)
    - What it does: AI recommendation for OverDrive ebook/audiobook catalog
    - Limitation: EBOOK/AUDIOBOOK ONLY - no physical books, DVDs, or LoT
    - Limitation: Only works within OverDrive ecosystem
    - Limitation: No conversational interface - button-based
    - Scout advantage: Cross-format discovery, conversational, full catalog

    OCLC WorldCat.org
    - What it does: Bibliographic search across libraries
    - Limitation: Catalog search, not discovery/recommendation
    - Limitation: Not conversational
    - Limitation: No personalization or natural language
    - Scout advantage: Discovery-focused, conversational, local catalog


TIER 2: ADJACENT COMPETITORS (Discovery Without LLM)

    BiblioCommons
    - What it does: Enhanced catalog interface, "similar titles"
    - Strength: Established vendor relationships, trusted
    - Limitation: No conversational AI (explicitly cautious on AI)
    - Limitation: Rule-based recommendations, not intelligent
    - Limitation: No cross-format bundling
    - Scout advantage: Natural language, true AI recommendation
    - Note: BiblioCommons is watching AI space but moving slowly

    NoveList (EBSCO)
    - What it does: Read-alike database for librarians
    - Strength: Comprehensive book relationship data
    - Limitation: Tool FOR librarians, not patron-facing
    - Limitation: Not conversational
    - Scout advantage: Direct patron interaction, conversational

    Syndetics Unbound
    - What it does: Enhanced catalog records with reviews, summaries
    - Limitation: Enrichment, not discovery
    - Scout advantage: Active discovery vs. passive enrichment


TIER 3: POTENTIAL FUTURE COMPETITORS

    Amazon (via library lending programs)
    - Threat level: Medium
    - If Amazon built library discovery, would prioritize own ecosystem
    - Scout advantage: Library-first, privacy-first, local collection

    Google (general AI)
    - Threat level: Low for library-specific
    - No indication of library-specific product
    - Scout advantage: Library catalog integration, library mission alignment

    Major ILS Vendors (SirsiDynix, Innovative, etc.)
    - Threat level: Medium-long term
    - Large vendors typically slow to innovate
    - May acquire rather than build
    - Scout advantage: Speed to market, focused solution


SCOUT'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
------------------------------

1. FIRST MOVER IN CATEGORY
   No production LLM discovery system exists. Scout defines the category.

2. CROSS-FORMAT DISCOVERY
   Book + audiobook + ebook + DVD + Library of Things in one conversation.
   OverDrive Inspire Me is ebook/audiobook only.

3. CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACE
   Natural language vs. buttons and dropdowns.
   Matches how people actually think about discovery.

4. PRIVACY-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
   Zero patron data logging. FERPA compliant.
   Major differentiator vs. big tech alternatives.

5. ACCESSIBILITY LEADERSHIP
   WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (ahead of 2026 ADA mandate).
   Positions Scout as compliance solution.

6. LIBRARY-ALIGNED MISSION
   "Protect the Soul of Librarianship" resonates with librarians.
   Not extractive big tech approach.


MARKET WINDOW ANALYSIS
----------------------

    2024-2025: Establishment Phase
    - No direct competitors
    - Scout can define category expectations
    - Build reference customers and case studies

    2025-2026: Growth Phase
    - Competitors may announce products
    - Scout has head start with integrations and customers
    - Network effects from librarian word-of-mouth

    2026-2027: Consolidation Phase
    - Major vendors may acquire or build
    - Scout either acquired, partnered, or established as leader
    - First-mover advantage cements market position


COMPETITIVE MESSAGING
---------------------

Against OverDrive Inspire Me:
"Scout discovers your ENTIRE collection - physical books, DVDs, Library of
Things, not just ebooks. One conversation, all formats."

Against BiblioCommons:
"Move beyond rule-based 'similar titles' to true conversational discovery.
Patrons describe what they want, Scout understands and recommends."

Against "We'll build it ourselves":
"Scout integrates in 2-3 days. Building in-house takes 6-12 months and
ongoing maintenance. Focus your team on patrons, not AI engineering."

Against "We'll wait for big vendors":
"Patrons are searching with AI today. Meeting them where they are increases
circulation now. Don't wait for vendors who are years behind."


ACTION ITEMS
------------
[ ] Monitor OverDrive Inspire Me adoption and limitations
[ ] Track BiblioCommons AI announcements
[ ] Document competitor feature gaps for sales conversations
[ ] Build case studies showing Scout advantages
[ ] Position Scout as "the library AI" before category is crowded

================================================================================
BRIEF 2: PATRON PAIN POINTS & PROBLEMS WE SOLVE
"Why Libraries Need Scout - Evidence-Based Value Proposition"
================================================================================
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Research documents four major patron pain points that Scout directly addresses:
library jargon barriers, discovery fragmentation, search abandonment, and
declining reference assistance. Each pain point has documented evidence and
a clear Scout solution.


PAIN POINT 1: LIBRARY JARGON BARRIERS
-------------------------------------

THE PROBLEM:
51% of library websites use jargon that patrons don't understand.
(Source: Market Research document)

Examples of problematic jargon:
- "OPAC" instead of "catalog" or "search"
- "ILL" instead of "get it from another library"
- "Circulation desk" instead of "checkout desk"
- "Bibliographic record" instead of "book information"
- "Serials" instead of "magazines and journals"
- "Stacks" instead of "bookshelves"

PATRON IMPACT:
- Confusion leads to search abandonment
- Patrons feel libraries are "not for them"
- Creates barrier for new library users
- Particularly impacts non-native English speakers

SCOUT SOLUTION:
- Natural language interface - patrons speak normally
- Scout translates jargon internally
- Responses use plain language
- Meets patrons at their vocabulary level

MESSAGING:
"Patrons don't need to learn library-speak. Scout understands 'I want a
good mystery' and translates it into catalog search."


PAIN POINT 2: DISCOVERY FRAGMENTATION
-------------------------------------

THE PROBLEM:
Library resources are scattered across multiple systems with no unified
discovery experience.

Typical patron experience:
- Search library catalog for physical books → one system
- Search OverDrive for ebooks/audiobooks → separate system
- Search databases for articles → another system
- Ask about programs/events → different system
- Library of Things → often not searchable at all

(Source: PRD, Market Research)

PATRON IMPACT:
- Multiple searches for one need
- Resources go undiscovered
- Patrons don't know what's available
- Lower circulation of non-book items

SCOUT SOLUTION:
- Single conversational interface
- Cross-format discovery (books, ebooks, audiobooks, DVDs, LoT)
- "We also have the audiobook" natural bridging
- One conversation reveals full library value

MESSAGING:
"One search, all formats. Scout shows patrons the FULL value of their
library card in a single conversation."


PAIN POINT 3: SEARCH ABANDONMENT
--------------------------------

THE PROBLEM:
Patrons give up when searches don't immediately yield results.
(Source: Market Research)

Causes of abandonment:
- "No results found" with no helpful alternatives
- Too many irrelevant results
- Unclear how to refine search
- Catalog interface is intimidating
- Don't know what terms to use

PATRON IMPACT:
- Lost circulation opportunities
- Patron frustration and disengagement
- Perception that "library doesn't have anything"
- Patrons turn to Amazon/Google instead

SCOUT SOLUTION:
- Natural language understands intent, not just keywords
- "No exact match, but here's something similar..."
- Clarifying questions refine naturally
- Always provides a path forward
- Recovery patterns for every dead end

MESSAGING:
"Scout never dead-ends. When the exact item isn't available, Scout offers
alternatives, places holds, and keeps patrons engaged."


PAIN POINT 4: DECLINING REFERENCE ASSISTANCE
--------------------------------------------

THE PROBLEM:
Reference desk transactions have declined from 50% to 35% of patron
interactions. 54% of libraries cite staff capacity as primary challenge.
(Source: Market Research)

Causes:
- Fewer staff to provide assistance
- Staff time consumed by routine questions
- Patrons hesitant to "bother" librarians
- Digital-first patrons don't approach desk

PATRON IMPACT:
- Less personalized guidance
- Routine questions go unasked
- Discovery happens without expert help
- Patron experience becomes transactional

SCOUT SOLUTION:
- 24/7 availability for routine questions
- Frees librarians for complex reference
- Patrons get help without waiting or asking
- Augments staff, doesn't replace
- Warm handoff to humans for complex needs

MESSAGING:
"Scout handles routine discovery questions so librarians can focus on
complex research and human connection. Augmentation, not replacement."


QUANTIFIED VALUE PROPOSITION
----------------------------

For Library Directors (ROI-focused):
- "Libraries using AI discovery see 40% more patrons finding resources"
- "Staff time savings of 30-50% on routine questions"
- "Increased circulation across all formats, including underutilized items"

For Reference Librarians (Workload-focused):
- "Scout handles 'What should I read?' so you can handle complex research"
- "Warm handoff ensures patrons reach you when they truly need expertise"
- "Frees time for programming, outreach, and community engagement"

For Technology Librarians (Implementation-focused):
- "2-3 day integration with existing ILS"
- "WCAG 2.2 AA compliant out of the box"
- "Zero patron data logging - privacy by design"


EVIDENCE FOR SALES CONVERSATIONS
--------------------------------

When libraries say: "Our patrons don't need this"
Response: "51% of library websites use jargon patrons don't understand.
Patrons WANT easier discovery but don't know how to ask for it."

When libraries say: "We have good search already"
Response: "Can your search understand 'something light for a beach trip'?
Scout translates patron intent into catalog results."

When libraries say: "Our librarians provide this service"
Response: "54% of libraries cite staff capacity challenges. Scout augments
your team for routine questions, freeing them for complex reference."

When libraries say: "Patrons don't like AI"
Response: "Patrons use AI daily (Google, Alexa, Siri). They expect
conversational interfaces. Scout feels like texting a helpful librarian."


ACTION ITEMS
------------
[ ] Compile patron quotes/testimonials about discovery frustration
[ ] Document before/after circulation metrics from pilots
[ ] Create pain point one-pager for sales conversations
[ ] Build ROI calculator for library directors

    - Availability check
    - Metadata retrieval
    Authentication: Library-specific credentials
    Documentation: developer.overdrive.com


INTEGRATION TIMELINE
--------------------

STANDARD INTEGRATION: 2-3 days
    Day 1: API credentials, connection testing
    Day 2: Search integration, result mapping
    Day 3: Testing, refinement, launch

COMPLEX INTEGRATION: 5-7 days
    - Custom ILS configurations
    - Multiple branch handling
    - Special collections integration

REQUIREMENTS FROM LIBRARY:
    - API credentials/access
    - ILS vendor contact (if needed)
    - Test environment (preferred)
    - Staff contact for testing


TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
---------------------

NO PATRON DATA STORAGE:
    - Scout does not store patron queries long-term
    - Session-only conversation memory
    - No patron authentication required (Phase 1)
    - Privacy by design

CATALOG-ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - Every recommendation verified against catalog
    - No hallucinated titles
    - Availability checked before display

CACHING STRATEGY:
    - Catalog metadata: Cached (refreshed daily)
    - Availability: Real-time or short cache (5 min)
    - Claude responses: Short cache for identical queries

RATE LIMITING:
    - Scout API: Configurable per library
    - ILS API: Respect library's limits
    - Claude API: Managed through batching


SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
---------------------

DATA IN TRANSIT:
    - All API calls over HTTPS
    - TLS 1.2+ required

API CREDENTIALS:
    - Stored in secure vault (not code)
    - Library-specific credentials
    - Rotatable without code changes

AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS:
    - API key (simplest)
    - OAuth 2.0 (more secure)
    - IP whitelist (additional layer)

COMPLIANCE:
    - WCAG 2.2 AA (accessibility)
    - FERPA (education data protection)
    - State privacy laws (varies)


INTEGRATION CHECKLIST
---------------------

PRE-INTEGRATION:
[ ] Confirm ILS type and version
[ ] Obtain API documentation
[ ] Request API credentials
[ ] Identify library technical contact
[ ] Confirm rate limits and restrictions

INTEGRATION:
[ ] Connect to ILS API (sandbox first)
[ ] Map data fields (title, author, format, availability)
[ ] Connect to OverDrive (if applicable)
[ ] Implement search result merging
[ ] Configure caching

TESTING:
[ ] Search functionality across formats
[ ] Availability accuracy
[ ] Edge cases (no results, special characters)
[ ] Performance under load
[ ] Mobile responsiveness

LAUNCH:
[ ] Production credentials
[ ] Monitoring setup
[ ] Staff training
[ ] Patron announcement (optional)


KNOWN INTEGRATION CHALLENGES
----------------------------

CHALLENGE: ILS data quality varies
- Some catalogs have inconsistent metadata
- Solution: Fuzzy matching, graceful handling

CHALLENGE: Format encoding differs
- "Book" vs "BK" vs "print" vs "physical"
- Solution: Format mapping table per ILS

CHALLENGE: Branch/location complexity
- Multi-branch systems have complex availability
- Solution: Aggregate or specify by branch

CHALLENGE: API rate limits
- High-traffic libraries may hit limits
- Solution: Caching, request batching

CHALLENGE: Real-time availability
- Some ILS have delayed availability updates
- Solution: Soft language ("typically available")


ACTION ITEMS
------------
[ ] Document Polaris API integration (first priority)
[ ] Document Koha API integration
[ ] Create ILS field mapping templates
[ ] Build integration checklist for onboarding
[ ] Establish OverDrive developer relationship
