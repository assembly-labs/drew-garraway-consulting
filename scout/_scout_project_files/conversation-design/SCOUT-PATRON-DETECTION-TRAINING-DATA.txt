SECTION 1: OVERVIEW & PATRON TYPE DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

PURPOSE OF PATRON DETECTION
---------------------------
Scout adapts its tone, vocabulary, pacing, and recommendations based on who
it's talking to. Accurate patron detection enables:

    - Appropriate language complexity
    - Relevant recommendation framing
    - Correct personality pairing
    - Better expansion timing
    - Higher satisfaction and engagement


THE SIX PATRON TYPES
--------------------

TYPE 1: CHILDREN & FAMILIES
    Who: Parents/caregivers searching for children, or children themselves
    Age range: Content for ages 0-12, searchers any age
    Key need: Age-appropriate, engaging, often series-based
    Personality match: Navigator, Storyteller, Explorer

TYPE 2: TEENS
    Who: Adolescents 13-19 searching for themselves
    Key need: Respect, no condescension, trending content
    Personality match: Enthusiast, Navigator
    Avoid: Scholar, Storyteller (feels parental)

TYPE 3: GENERAL ADULTS
    Who: Adults 20-60 with general reading interests
    Key need: Efficiency, relevance, respect for taste
    Personality match: Navigator, Curator, Helper, Enthusiast
    Note: Largest and most diverse group

TYPE 4: SENIORS
    Who: Older adults 65+, may have accessibility needs
    Key need: Patience, clarity, dignity, accessibility options
    Personality match: Storyteller, Navigator, Curator
    Avoid: Enthusiast (may feel disrespectful)

TYPE 5: STUDENTS/RESEARCHERS
    Who: Students (high school through graduate), academics, professionals
    Key need: Credible sources, appropriate depth, deadline awareness
    Personality match: Scholar, Navigator, Helper

TYPE 6: HOBBYISTS/ENTHUSIASTS
    Who: Deep interest in specific topics, may be experts
    Key need: Depth, respect for expertise, non-obvious recommendations
    Personality match: Scholar, Curator, Explorer, Helper


DETECTION CONFIDENCE LEVELS
---------------------------

    HIGH CONFIDENCE (90%+):
    Multiple strong signals align. Respond with full adaptation.
    Example: "my 7 year old loves dog man" → clearly parent/child

    MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (60-89%):
    Some signals present but not definitive. Adapt moderately.
    Example: "mystery recommendations" → likely adult, but could be teen

    LOW CONFIDENCE (<60%):
    Signals ambiguous or conflicting. Use Navigator default.
    Example: "books" → no patron signals, stay neutral

    CONFLICTING SIGNALS:
    Different signals suggest different types. Clarify or use safest option.
    Example: Formal vocabulary but YA request → could be parent, librarian, or mature teen


================================================================================
SECTION 2: DETECTION SIGNAL FRAMEWORK

Signals are weighted cues that suggest patron type. Multiple signals combine
for higher confidence.

Higher complexity suggests: senior (formal), student (academic), or hobbyist (specialized)

SPECIALIZED VOCABULARY:
    - Academic terms → student/researcher
    - Genre terms → hobbyist
    - Dated slang → senior
    - Current slang → teen
    - Industry terms → professional hobbyist


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.5 MESSAGE LENGTH PATTERNS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY SHORT (1-5 words): Teen, child, or efficient adult
SHORT (6-15 words): Most patrons
MEDIUM (16-30 words): Adults, students, seniors
LONG (30+ words): Seniors, researchers, hobbyists with complex needs

SECTION 11: IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
================================================================================

How to use this training data in Scout's development.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.1 CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: Extract signals from query
    - Vocabulary signals (keywords, slang, formality)
    - Topic signals (content requested)
    - Tone signals (greeting, punctuation, length)
    - Context signals (mentions of roles, relationships, occasions)

STEP 2: Score each patron type
    - Each signal adds weight to relevant type(s)
    - High-weight signals: +3 points
    - Medium-weight signals: +2 points
    - Low-weight signals: +1 point

STEP 3: Calculate confidence
    - If one type scores significantly higher: High confidence
    - If two types are close: Medium confidence, note both
    - If no type stands out: Low confidence, use default

STEP 4: Handle conflicts
    - If signals conflict, identify the CONTENT need vs. COMMUNICATION style
    - Example: Parent asking for teen content → Parent mode, teen content

STEP 5: Adapt response
    - Apply personality appropriate to detected type
    - Adjust vocabulary complexity
    - Adjust response length
    - Adjust expansion timing


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.2 SYSTEM PROMPT INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add to system prompt:

    PATRON DETECTION:
    Analyze each query for patron type signals:
    - Children/Family: age mentions, "my kid", children's content
    - Teen: casual language, "ya", trending titles, slang
    - Adult: neutral signals, adult topics, professional context
    - Senior: formal language, large print, classic authors
    - Student: academic context, deadlines, sources needed
    - Hobbyist: deep genre knowledge, specific subgenres

    ADAPTATION RULES:
    - Children/Family: simpler vocabulary, shorter responses, series mentions
    - Teens: casual tone, no lecturing, respect their taste
    - Adults: efficient, match their formality
    - Seniors: patient, clear, mention accessibility options
    - Students: focused on their actual need, source quality
    - Hobbyists: respect expertise, go beyond obvious suggestions


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.3 FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES FOR PROMPTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Include 2-3 examples per patron type in system prompt:

CHILDREN/FAMILY EXAMPLE:
    Query: "books for my 7 year old who loves animals"
    Detection: Parent searching for child (age mention, "my X year old")
    Response: [warm, suggests age-appropriate, mentions series]

TEEN EXAMPLE:
    Query: "ya fantasy recs??"
    Detection: Teen (casual, "ya", "recs", punctuation)
    Response: [casual tone, no condescension, trending titles]

SENIOR EXAMPLE:
    Query: "Good morning. I enjoy Maeve Binchy. Similar authors please."
    Detection: Senior (formal greeting, classic author)
    Response: [warm, patient, mentions large print/audio options]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.4 TESTING PROTOCOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEST SET REQUIREMENTS:
    - 20 queries per patron type (120 total)
    - Mix of high, medium, and low confidence
    - Include edge cases and conflicts

ACCURACY TARGETS:
    - High confidence queries: 90%+ correct classification
    - Medium confidence queries: 75%+ correct classification
    - Low confidence queries: Appropriate default response

FAILURE ANALYSIS:
    - Track misclassifications by type
    - Identify missing signals
    - Update training data with new patterns


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.5 ITERATION PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEEKLY:
    - Review misclassified queries
    - Add new signal patterns observed
    - Refine weights for existing signals

MONTHLY:
    - Run full test suite
    - Update training data with new patterns
    - Adjust classification thresholds

QUARTERLY:
    - Review patron type definitions
    - Consider new patron types if patterns emerge
    - Update few-shot examples


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.6 PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT:
    - Detection uses query content only, not stored history
    - No patron data is stored between sessions
    - Classification happens per-query, not per-person
    - Signals are linguistic patterns, not personal identification

APPENDIX A: QUICK REFERENCE - SIGNALS BY TYPE
================================================================================

CHILDREN/FAMILY:
    High: "my kid/child", age mentions, children's content
    Medium: "chapter books", "picture books", series titles
    Low: Simple sentence structure, narrow topics

TEENS:
    High: Slang (ngl, tbh, lowkey), "booktok", "ya"
    Medium: Casual tone, lowercase, trending titles
    Low: Short messages, minimal punctuation

GENERAL ADULTS:
    High: Professional context, adult life topics
    Medium: Standard formality, mainstream titles
    Low: (Default when no strong signals)

SENIORS:
    High: "large print", formal greetings, classic authors
    Medium: Polite phrasing, accessibility mentions
    Low: Complete sentences, traditional preferences

STUDENTS/RESEARCHERS:
    High: "for class", "thesis", "sources", academic vocab
    Medium: Course/subject mentions, deadline awareness
    Low: Information-seeking phrasing

HOBBYISTS:
    High: Subgenre specificity, "already read X", technical depth
    Medium: Author name-dropping, trope vocabulary
    Low: Quality distinctions, completist interests


================================================================================
APPENDIX B: SIGNAL WEIGHT TABLE
================================================================================

+3 POINTS (High weight - near definitive):
    - "my X year old" → Children/Family
    - "for class/thesis/paper" → Student
    - "large print" → Senior
    - "booktok", "ngl", "tbh" → Teen
    - "I've already read [multiple specific titles]" → Hobbyist

+2 POINTS (Medium weight - strong indicator):
    - Age mentions → Children/Family
    - "ya" → Teen
    - Formal greeting + politeness → Senior
    - Academic vocabulary → Student
    - Deep subgenre terms → Hobbyist
    - Slang (current) → Teen

+1 POINT (Low weight - supporting evidence):
    - Children's content → Possibly family
    - Lowercase/minimal punctuation → Possibly teen
    - Adult life topics → Possibly adult
    - Complete sentences → Possibly senior
    - Quality criteria → Possibly hobbyist
