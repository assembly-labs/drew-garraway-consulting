Librarian LLM: A $20-50M market opportunity in an underserved sector
The US public library market presents a compelling opportunity for an LLM-based discovery product. The research reveals a $3.75 billion annual technology market serving 171 million patrons through 9,194 library systems, with virtually no competitive LLM-based solutions currently deployed in public libraries. Libraries face documented pain points in discovery and patron service, supported by $400+ million in annual federal grant funding for technology innovation, with clear technical pathways for integration through standardized APIs. Conservative projections suggest achievable revenue of $20-50M within three years through consortium-based sales targeting mid-to-large library systems struggling with staff capacity constraints and siloed digital content discovery.
This opportunity window exists now because major library technology vendors only began adding AI features in 2024-2025, creating a 2-3 year first-mover advantage before market consolidation. Libraries are actively seeking solutions as operating budgets grew 7.9% in 2024 while reference desk assistance from librarians declined from 50% to 35% of in-person visitors, signaling unmet demand for self-service discovery tools. The convergence of documented user frustration, available integration infrastructure, proven funding mechanisms, and absence of dominant competitors creates ideal conditions for market entry.
Competition is surprisingly thin in public library AI discovery
The competitive landscape research uncovered a striking finding: no production-ready LLM-based discovery system exists specifically for US public libraries. While academic libraries have seen AI innovation from vendors like Ex Libris (Primo Research Assistant, launched September 2024) and EBSCO (AI Insights, beta June 2024), public library offerings remain extremely limited.
The most relevant competitive product is OverDrive's "Inspire Me" feature in Libby, which launched August 2025 for digital collections only. This AI-powered recommendation engine operates exclusively within OverDrive's ebook/audiobook ecosystem and cannot search physical library catalogs or recommend materials across platforms. BiblioCommons, the dominant public library discovery platform serving 550+ libraries across 2,300 locations, has explicitly stated they're exploring AI but taking a "highly cautious approach" with no announced product timeline. Their reluctance stems from privacy and accuracy concerns fundamental to library values.
The vendor landscape shows major players adding AI features to existing products rather than launching standalone AI discovery systems. OCLC introduced AI-powered book recommendations to WorldCat.org in beta (June 2023), but this serves as an enhancement to their massive bibliographic database rather than a conversational patron interface. Most library AI activity consists of reference chatbots deployed at individual institutions rather than market-ready commercial products. San José State University built KingbotGPT using OpenAI's API with a RAG architecture, but this remains a custom implementation requiring technical expertise to replicate. Columbia University and Georgia Tech have similar pilot projects, all in academic rather than public library settings.
Open-source initiatives and startups present minimal competition. The startup landscape for library-specific AI discovery tools is essentially nonexistent—searches revealed general book recommendation apps like BookSurfAI and Libromatch, but none integrate with library catalogs or target institutional sales. The library technology market remains dominated by established vendors (Clarivate, EBSCO, OCLC, SirsiDynix) who face internal innovation cycles measured in years rather than months. Innovative Interfaces announced 152 Vega Discover installations in 2024 but has not incorporated LLM capabilities into this next-generation discovery interface.
This competitive vacuum exists because libraries operate under constraints that deter generic tech companies. Patron privacy is non-negotiable — libraries cannot monetize user data, unlike commercial recommendation systems. Accuracy requirements are absolute, as library professionals will reject tools that hallucinate or provide incorrect information. The procurement process is complex, involving lengthy RFPs, consortium approvals, and 18-24 month sales cycles that discourage venture-backed startups seeking rapid growth. Yet these same barriers create a defensible moat for solutions purpose-built for the library market with appropriate governance.
Patrons struggle with library catalogs while staff capacity declines
Market validation research reveals fundamental problems with current library discovery systems that LLM technology could directly address. A comprehensive review of 16 library usability studies identified library jargon as the top problem, cited in 10 of 16 studies—only 49% of library websites were jargon-free. Users encounter impenetrable terminology like "COPAC," "Link+," "Engine Orange," "360Link," and "periodical" when they simply want to find books. The second-most-common problem, documented in 7 of 16 studies, is that users fundamentally don't understand what's included in search boxes—23% of North Carolina State University's single search box queries were for content not even present in the catalog, as users typed database subjects into interfaces designed for physical books.
Traditional library catalogs require Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) and exact keyword matching, creating what researchers call "when smart people fail" scenarios documented since 1989. Natural language searches "do not work well" in library databases despite users expecting Google-like functionality. This creates search abandonment and patron frustration, while 75% of users couldn't successfully navigate to full-text PDFs on commercial database sites even when content was available. The fragmentation is severe — users must separately search their library catalog, OverDrive for ebooks, Hoopla for movies/music, and Kanopy for documentaries, with no unified discovery layer across these silos.
Pew Research data from 2016 shows patron behavior trends that support AI-powered self-service. Help from librarians dropped from 50% of in-person visitors in 2012 to just 35% in 2015, suggesting users want tools that enable independent discovery. Yet catalog search remains the number-one digital activity at 58% of website users, demonstrating that patrons still need to find materials—they just want better tools than current systems provide. Mobile access grew from 39% in 2012 to 49% by 2016, while library mobile app usage paradoxically remains low at just 8%, indicating that current library apps fail to meet user expectations despite proven comfort with mobile interfaces.
The Edmonton Public Library's groundbreaking barriers study identified service awareness as the fourth-highest barrier to library utilization—people simply don't understand what services exist and how those services can benefit their lives. This information gap creates a perfect use case for conversational AI that can proactively explain collections, recommend relevant materials based on interests, and guide patrons through the complexity that library professionals navigate daily. Reader's advisory research shows 92% of librarians consider personalized recommendations important or very important, up 8 points from 2013, yet librarians report inadequate time and training to provide quality advisory services. Patron-selected books circulate twice as often as librarian-selected titles (4.1 vs 2.4 mean circulation at Purdue), proving personalization drives usage when implemented.
The research validates that 24/7 availability addresses genuine need. Only 6% of library users access Wi-Fi when buildings are closed, and reference desk hours don't match patron schedules. Early chatbot implementations like San José State's received "strong positive feedback" for providing always-available assistance. Natural language interfaces work particularly well for novice users and simple queries, reducing cognitive load compared to Boolean search syntax. The value proposition is clear: an LLM that understands patron intent, explains options in plain language, searches across siloed platforms, and operates around the clock would directly solve documented pain points affecting millions of library users.
IMLS grants up to $750,000 provide clear funding pathway
Federal grant funding opportunities specifically target library technology innovation with AI projects explicitly mentioned in program goals. The Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grants program offers $50,000-$750,000 awards for 1-3 year projects, with preliminary proposals due September 20 annually. Analysis of recent awards shows IMLS funded at least eight AI-related library projects from 2020-2024, establishing clear precedent for LLM development.
Northwestern University received an NLG grant (LG-256703-OLS-24) for a generative AI semantic discovery tool, specifically building open-source chat-based search using LLMs. The University of Virginia secured $149,842 for generative AI applications in open educational resources. SUNY Albany received LG-254889-OLS-23 to research public libraries' role in AI civic engagement. Montana State, James Madison, and Iowa State jointly won LG-252307-OLS-22 for responsible AI frameworks in libraries and archives. The University of Maryland iSchool got funding for a user-centered chatbot using generative AI for collection discovery. These awards demonstrate IMLS actively funds LLM-based discovery systems when proposals show national impact and ethical AI frameworks.
The successful project characteristics are consistent: open-source tool development, national dissemination plans, training components for library professionals, ethical considerations prominently featured, and multi-institution partnerships. Award amounts cluster in two ranges—$50,000-$150,000 for planning/research and $150,000-$500,000 for implementation projects. The two-phase application process requires preliminary proposals in September with invited full proposals due the following March, meaning the development timeline is 18-24 months from initial concept to project start.
State LSTA grants administered through all 50 state library agencies provide complementary funding. California's LSTA allocation of $15.9 million annually supports Community Impact Grants ranging from $50,000-$100,000+ for individual libraries or collaborative projects. Massachusetts restructured grants into Explore, Inspire, and Impact tiers with awards up to $250,000 for large-scale initiatives. Texas offers Special Projects grants for technology and digital services. These state programs typically have faster application cycles than federal grants and can support regional pilots before national expansion.
Foundation funding presents longer-term opportunities though current programs are mostly by invitation. The Knight Foundation has invested $12+ million in library innovation since 1971, including nearly $5 million through two Knight News Challenge on Libraries programs (2014, 2016). Individual awards ranged from $35,000-$393,249 for projects addressing 21st century information needs. The Digital Public Library of America received $750,000 in 2020 specifically for advancing digital technologies. The Mellon Foundation awarded ALA $5.515 million in 2023 for general operating support including digital access initiatives, demonstrating eight-figure foundation engagement when projects align with organizational priorities.
The Digital Equity Act created $2.75 billion in funding through competitive grants and state capacity grants, with libraries explicitly eligible. While not technology-development focused, Digital Equity funding could support deployment if Librarian LLM addresses underserved populations or digital divide issues. The program opened applications in July 2024 with all 50 states now having digital equity plans that include library components.
The grant funding strategy should prioritize IMLS National Leadership implementation grants in the $250,000-$500,000 range for initial development over two years, with concurrent state LSTA applications in 2-3 states for $50,000-$100,000 to support community engagement and pilot testing. Foundation funding from Knight or Mellon becomes viable after proof-of-concept with IMLS credibility established. The application timeline should begin immediately with program officer discussions, needs assessment documentation, and partner recruitment to submit preliminary proposals by September 2025.
Integration with existing systems is technically feasible
The library technology infrastructure research confirms that comprehensive APIs exist across major library management systems, making technical integration achievable. The market consolidated around a few dominant vendors, with Clarivate's Polaris serving 704 public library installations, SirsiDynix's Symphony at 2,104 installations, and open-source Koha deployed at 1,653 locations. Together these three platforms represent roughly 50% of the US public library market.
All major systems now offer REST APIs with OAuth 2.0 authentication and JSON data formats. Polaris provides a comprehensive REST API (PAPI) with capabilities for patron account management, bibliographic data access, item availability, circulation operations, and real-time holds placement. Developer documentation includes sandbox environments and code examples. Sierra's REST API (currently v6.6) supports client credentials grants for system-level access and authorization code grants for patron-specific operations, with interactive documentation and test servers available. Koha's open-source architecture includes OpenAPI specifications with complete CRUD operations across all library functions, backed by active community support through GitHub and developer forums.
The OverDrive Developer Portal offers library account APIs and metadata APIs, enabling integration with the dominant digital content platform serving 92,000+ library subscribers. As of June 2024, OverDrive added Libby share links to metadata APIs, facilitating direct linking to ebooks and audiobooks. Hoopla and Kanopy offer similar authentication mechanisms through library card validation against ILS patron databases. This means a unified discovery layer could technically aggregate physical collections, OverDrive, Hoopla, and Kanopy into single search results—directly solving the siloed content problem that frustrates both librarians and patrons.
Authentication standards align across the industry. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect have become standard for modern library APIs, with SAML 2.0 used for enterprise single sign-on in larger systems. SIP2 protocol provides universal support for self-service functions, while NCIP handles interlibrary loan and resource sharing. All systems export and import MARC21 bibliographic data, though some movement toward linked data formats (BIBFRAME) is occurring slowly. The standards compliance means integration work is engineering effort rather than fundamental research—the protocols are documented, tested, and production-ready.
Cloud migration trends favor new entrants. Library systems increasingly operate as vendor-hosted SaaS rather than on-premise installations, reducing the technical burden on individual libraries. Marshall Breeding's 2025 assessment notes that "outdated functionality and security concerns are driving migrations" to cloud platforms, with cybersecurity threats accelerating this transition. Only 20.7% of public libraries maintain full-time IT staff, meaning libraries need turnkey solutions that integrate via APIs rather than requiring local server management. This preference for hosted services aligns perfectly with an LLM-based product deployed as cloud SaaS.
The open-source movement in libraries, particularly FOLIO's growth to 200+ libraries in 2024, signals receptivity to best-of-breed integration approaches rather than monolithic vendor lock-in. BiblioCommons demonstrates the success of a discovery layer that works across multiple ILS platforms—their 550+ libraries use Polaris, Sierra, Symphony, Horizon, Evergreen, and Koha underneath, proving that API-based integration can span the vendor landscape. Montgomery County Maryland's migration to Koha with Aspen Discovery (serving 1+ million residents) shows even large systems choosing flexible architectures over proprietary stacks.
The recommended integration strategy should prioritize Polaris and Koha APIs for MVP development, targeting the 704 Polaris libraries and 1,653 Koha locations (2,357 combined). This focuses initial engineering on well-documented APIs serving progressive libraries—Koha users particularly represent early adopters comfortable with open-source innovation. Phase two expansion would add Sierra and Symphony support, accessing an additional 2,749 installations. The architecture should position Librarian LLM as an enhancement layer rather than ILS replacement, working alongside existing investments in discovery platforms like BiblioCommons while providing the AI capabilities those systems lack.
A $20-50M opportunity serving capacity-constrained libraries
Market sizing reveals substantial opportunity across 9,194 US public library systems operating 17,329 branches and serving 171+ million registered cardholders. Annual library technology spending totals $3.75 billion, with the average library budgeting $408,100 for technology in 2023. Enterprise software (ILS, discovery systems, digital platforms) typically consumes 33% of technology budgets, representing approximately $135,000 per library annually. The 2024 operating budget increase of 7.9% represents the largest growth in a decade, signaling financial capacity for new initiatives despite historically conservative spending patterns.
The addressable market segments into three tiers with distinct characteristics. Large urban systems with 100+ branches represent less than 1% of entities but serve 37% of the US population. These systems maintain dedicated IT staff (67.6% full-time), allocate $950,000+ to programming, and achieve 93% adoption of streaming services with 75% offering maker equipment. They're natural early adopters with pricing tolerance of $50,000-$150,000 annually and capacity for complex implementations. Mid-size systems with 10-100 branches comprise 17% of entities serving 41% of the population, with technology budgets of $100,000-$500,000 and strong consortium participation. This segment represents the scalability sweet spot at $20,000-$50,000 annual pricing through group contracts. Small libraries under 10 branches are 82% of systems serving 22% of population, heavily reliant on consortium support with limited IT capacity, best served through freemium-to-$10,000 models with self-service deployment.
Consortium infrastructure enables rapid scaling once credibility is established. State library agencies in all 50 states distribute federal LSTA funding and coordinate purchasing agreements. The consortial model means a single contract can reach 20-60 libraries simultaneously—MOBIUS Consortium operates a shared FOLIO instance for 62 libraries, while GALILEO serves 27 institutions through unified systems. The average consortium saves member libraries $7 million annually through group purchasing, creating strong incentives for technology standardization. E-rate participation at 52.3% of libraries demonstrates comfort with federal funding mechanisms that could support Librarian LLM adoption.
Staff capacity constraints create the core value proposition. The PLA 2023 survey found 54% of libraries cite staff capacity as their primary technology challenge, more than twice the rate of any other barrier. Only 20.7% maintain full-time IT staff, with rural libraries particularly dependent on external support (3.3% have no IT support whatsoever). Reference assistance declining from 50% to 35% of visitors indicates unmet demand that self-service AI could address, while 85.7% cite subscription costs as barriers to digital content, suggesting pricing sensitivity requires clear ROI demonstration. The average library could justify $20,000-$50,000 annually if Librarian LLM saves even one full-time-equivalent in staff hours or increases circulation enough to demonstrate community value.
Digital services adoption patterns validate the product concept. E-book and audiobook availability reached 95% of libraries by 2023, while streaming media serves 58% overall (93% of urban libraries). Hotspot lending grew 14.3 percentage points from 2020-2023, laptop circulation increased 8.1 points, and 95.3% now offer digital literacy training. Mobile access accounts for 49% of library website usage, yet native library apps achieve only 8% adoption, indicating interface friction that modern mobile-first LLM tools could solve. The success of Libby demonstrates that purpose-built apps can achieve high adoption when user experience exceeds traditional library catalogs.
Conservative revenue projections based on tiered market penetration suggest $500,000-$2 million in Year 1 with 50 -100 early adopter libraries, growing to $5-15 million in Year 2 through 300-500 libraries including 3-5 consortium contracts. Year 3 targets $20-50 million with 1,500+ libraries including 15-25 major consortium partnerships. This assumes average revenue per library of $13,000-$33,000 blending large direct sales, mid-tier consortium deals, and community tier subscriptions. The long-term addressable market of 5,000 - 7,000 libraries with modern ILS platforms and technology budget control represents $60 - 84 million in annual potential at conservative per-library pricing.
The success probability is 70-80% with proper execution because the opportunity combines documented pain points, available integration infrastructure, established funding mechanisms, minimal competition, and favorable market timing. The barriers—budget constraints, long sales cycles, privacy requirements, fragmented vendor landscape—are significant but manageable through consortium-first sales strategy, freemium entry tiers, privacy-by-design architecture, and phased ILS support rollout. Libraries reward solutions that genuinely solve problems rather than checking technology trend boxes, meaning product-market fit validation through 5-10 pilot partnerships should precede aggressive scaling.
Strategic recommendations for market entry
The research findings support a phased market entry beginning with grant-funded development and pilot partnerships, followed by consortium-based scaling, ultimately targeting $20-50 million in revenue within three years. Begin immediately with IMLS National Leadership Grant preliminary proposal preparation for September 2025 submission, requesting $400,000-$500,000 over two years to develop open-source LLM discovery tools with national dissemination. Concurrent state LSTA applications in California, Massachusetts, and Texas should target $50,000-$100,000 each for community engagement and pilot testing in diverse library contexts.
The MVP should focus on solving the unified discovery problem that both research and competitive analysis identified as unaddressed. Build a conversational interface that searches across physical library catalogs, OverDrive, Hoopla, and Kanopy simultaneously using natural language queries, with integration to Polaris and Koha APIs covering 2,357 initial potential customers. The core feature set must include natural language search understanding user intent rather than requiring Boolean logic, conversational recommendations based on patron interests, smart query reformulation when searches fail, and "explain this book" functionality using catalog metadata augmented by LLM synthesis. Deploy as cloud-hosted SaaS requiring no local IT resources, with library-branded white-label options and mobile-responsive web interface initially.
Recruit 5-10 pilot partners spanning size tiers—two large urban systems (100+ branches), three mid-size systems (10-100 branches), and five small libraries (under 10 branches). Target progressive libraries with existing open-source or cloud-based systems, tech-savvy leadership, documented staff capacity challenges, and willingness to provide detailed usage data. Montgomery County Maryland (Koha user serving 1+ million), select Polaris customers frustrated with siloed digital content, and consortium members seeking innovative solutions would represent ideal pilot candidates. These partnerships must generate quantified impact data showing 30-50% staff time savings on routine reference and increased circulation through better recommendations.
The pricing strategy should establish three tiers: Community ($0-$5,000/year) with basic AI reference assistance and monthly query limits for proof-of-concept adoption; Professional ($5,000-$25,000/year) with unlimited queries, ILS integration, and email support targeting mid-size systems; and Enterprise ($25,000-$100,000+/year) with custom integrations, dedicated support, and multi-branch management for large urban libraries and consortia. Volume discounts of 30-40% for consortium contracts incentivize group purchases that drive rapid scaling. Per-patron pricing alternatives at $0.10-$0.50 per registered user annually provide budget flexibility for libraries accustomed to population-based cost models.
Privacy architecture must be foundational rather than retrofitted. Implement zero-logging of personally identifiable search queries, local deployment options for privacy-sensitive systems, transparent AI decision explanations, and third-party privacy audits with published results. Pursue SOC 2 compliance from launch, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility as minimum standard, and multilingual support for Spanish, Chinese, and other high-need languages. These requirements are non-negotiable for public sector adoption—libraries will reject products that compromise patron privacy regardless of feature sophistication or cost advantages.
The go-to-market timeline should prioritize consortium relationships over individual library direct sales. State library associations represent the fastest path to credibility—present at state conferences, offer free pilot partnerships to state libraries who can recommend to members, and document case studies demonstrating measurable impact. Major consortia like Statewide California Electronic Library Consortium (SCELC), LYRASIS (serving 1,500+ libraries), and TexShare can provide access to hundreds of libraries through single contracts. ALA and PLA partnerships through exhibiting at conferences, publishing in Library Journal and American Libraries, and participating in working groups on AI ethics establish thought leadership with professional gatekeepers who influence purchasing decisions.
Integration partnerships with ILS vendors can accelerate adoption if structured correctly. Rather than competing with Clarivate, SirsiDynix, or ByWater Solutions, position Librarian LLM as complementary best-of-breed AI capabilities that enhance their core platforms. White-label licensing allows vendors to bundle AI discovery with existing products, while co-marketing agreements provide access to established customer bases. BiblioCommons presents both competitive and partnership opportunities—their 550-library network represents high-value targets, while their cautious AI stance creates a 2-3 year window before they launch competing features. An integration that works alongside BiblioCommons while adding conversational AI capabilities avoids forcing libraries to choose between proven discovery platforms and innovative AI tools.
The critical success factors beyond technology are deeply understanding library culture and values. Librarians champion intellectual freedom, patron privacy, equitable access, and accuracy over innovation for its own sake. Product positioning must emphasize how LLM technology serves these core values—expanding access to underserved populations, protecting privacy through thoughtful architecture, improving accuracy through RAG approaches grounded in verified catalog data, and reducing barriers through natural language interfaces. Frame Librarian LLM not as automation replacing librarians but as tools amplifying their expertise to reach more patrons, especially during off-hours when buildings are closed but community information needs persist.
The window for market entry is now because major vendors only began adding AI features in 2024-2025, creating a temporary competitive vacuum before market consolidation occurs. Libraries are actively seeking solutions as evidenced by 61% developing AI programs, yet the research shows no production-ready LLM discovery systems exist for public libraries specifically. Federal grant funding explicitly supports AI innovation projects, providing non-dilutive capital for development. Operating budgets grew 7.9% in 2024 while staff capacity declined, creating both financial capacity and urgent need for solutions. This convergence of factors creates a 2-3 year opportunity before either incumbent vendors or well-funded tech companies dominate the space, meaning immediate action on grant applications and pilot partnerships is essential to capture first-mover advantage in this underserved but substantial market.
