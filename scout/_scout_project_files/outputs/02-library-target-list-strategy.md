# Scout & Finch: Target Library Prioritization Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and engaging with US public libraries for Scout & Finch adoption. Based on our context research and upcoming Tredyffrin demo, we're targeting libraries using Polaris, Koha, and Sierra ILS systems, with initial focus on Pennsylvania and Delaware (local advantage) plus high-opportunity states.

**Key Strategy Points:**
- Leverage local Philadelphia/Delaware presence for warm introductions
- Prioritize Polaris, Koha, and Sierra ILS (Tredyffrin uses Vega/Sierra)
- Focus on 7 states including PA/DE for local advantage
- Align outreach timing with library fiscal year cycles (January-March is prime)
- Build from individual libraries to consortiums for scale

## Segmentation Criteria

### Tier 1: Ideal Beta Candidates (30-50 libraries)

**Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 25K-100K patrons served (sweet spot for budget and need)
- **ILS:** Currently using Polaris, Koha, or Sierra (proven integration paths)
- **Geography:** Located in innovation-friendly states, prioritizing PA/DE region
- **Budget:** $15K-$35K available for new software tools
- **Innovation Indicators:**
  - Recent technology adoptions (self-checkout, maker spaces, digital services)
  - Active social media presence
  - Participation in state/national innovation programs
  - Library director speaks at conferences
  - Recent grant recipients for technology projects

**Why This Tier First:**
- Budget authority at director level (faster decisions)
- Sophisticated enough to be early adopters
- Not so large that procurement is byzantine
- Staff size creates real pain points Finch solves
- Influence on peer libraries in region
- Likely to provide actionable feedback

**Outreach Priority:** Immediate (December 2024 - February 2025)

### Tier 2: Early Adopter Prospects (100-150 libraries)

**Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 15K-75K patrons (broader range)
- **ILS:** Polaris, Koha, OR Sierra (Phase 2 integration)
- **Geography:** Secondary markets in target states
- **Budget:** $10K-$25K for software
- **Innovation Indicators:**
  - Follow industry trends but not first movers
  - Look to Tier 1 libraries for validation
  - Active in state library associations
  - Have dedicated IT or tech services librarian

**Why This Tier Second:**
- Need peer validation from Tier 1
- Larger addressable market
- May need more hand-holding
- Good for scaling after product refinement
- Can approach with case studies from Tier 1

**Outreach Priority:** March-May 2025 (after Tier 1 pilots show results)

### Tier 3: Consortium & System Opportunities (10-15 consortia)

**Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 5-50 member libraries per consortium

- Shared implementation costs
- Peer pressure for adoption
- Simplified procurement

**Outreach Priority:** June-August 2025 (with proven results from Tiers 1-2)

### Tier 4: Large Urban Systems (Future)

**Characteristics:**
- **Size:** 250K+ patrons
- **Examples:** NYPL, Chicago Public, LA Public
