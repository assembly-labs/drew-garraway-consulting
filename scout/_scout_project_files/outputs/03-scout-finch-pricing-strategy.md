# Scout & Finch: Pricing & Demo Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines pricing architecture, demo offerings, and conversion strategies for Scout & Finch. Based on market research showing average library technology budgets of $408,100 with 33% allocated to software beyond ILS (~$135,000), we're positioning our solution at $7,995-$39,995 annually to capture budget without triggering complex procurement.

**Key Decisions Required:**
1. Bundle vs. Separate pricing (Recommendation: Bundle for simplicity)
2. Specific tier pricing within validated ranges
3. Beta/pilot incentive structure
4. Demo delivery approach (Drew personally vs. scaled approach)

---

## Pricing Architecture Decision

### Option A: Bundle Pricing (Scout + Finch Together) **[RECOMMENDED]**

**Rationale for Bundling:**
- Simpler sales conversation (one product, one price)
- Higher perceived value (comprehensive solution)
- Easier procurement (single PO, single vendor)
- Better competitive positioning vs. point solutions
- Natural upsell from either product to bundle
- Aligns with library preference for integrated solutions

**Bundle Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Service Population | Annual Price | What's Included | Target Libraries |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Starter** | <25K patrons | **$7,995** | Scout + Finch Lite (2 staff seats) | Small libraries, rural systems |
| **Professional** | 25K-75K patrons | **$18,995** | Scout + Finch Pro (unlimited seats) | Mid-sized libraries (sweet spot) |
| **Enterprise** | 75K-250K patrons | **$39,995** | Scout + Finch Pro + Premium Support | Large county systems |
| **Strategic** | 250K+ patrons | **Custom** | White-glove implementation | Urban systems (Year 2) |

**Finch Lite vs. Pro Differentiation:**

**Finch Lite (Included in Starter):**
- 2 staff user accounts
- Basic onboarding content (pre-loaded)
- Email support only
- Monthly usage reports
- Standard integrations (ILS + OverDrive)

**Finch Pro (Professional & Enterprise):**
- Unlimited staff accounts
- Custom knowledge base setup
- Phone + email support
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- All integrations (ILS + OverDrive + databases)
- Workflow automation builder
- API access (Enterprise only)

### Option B: Separate Pricing (If Unbundling Required)

**When to Offer Separate Pricing:**
- Library explicitly says "we only want patron-facing"
- Budget constraints require phased adoption
- Consortium wants to test one product first
- Grant funding restricted to specific use case

**Standalone Pricing:**

**Scout Only:**
- Starter: $5,995
- Professional: $12,995
- Enterprise: $24,995

**Finch Add-On:**
- Lite: +$3,000 (any tier)
- Pro: +$7,000 (Professional)
- Pro+: +$15,000 (Enterprise)

**Conversion Strategy:**
- Start with Scout (easier to explain)
- Demo Finch during implementation
- Offer 20% bundle discount to upgrade

## Pricing FAQs & Objection Handling

### "What does it cost?"

**Response Framework:**
"Our Professional tier, which most libraries your size choose, is $18,995 annually for both Scout and Finch. This includes [specific benefits]. To put that in perspective, it's less than half the cost of one library assistant, but provides 24/7 support for both patrons and staff. Should I send you detailed pricing for all tiers?"

### "We don't have budget"

**Response Options:**
1. **Grant Angle:** "Many libraries use LSTA or state grants. We can provide language for your application."
2. **Pilot Angle:** "We offer a 3-month pilot at $2,374 to prove ROI before full commitment."
3. **Timing Angle:** "When does your new fiscal year begin? We can time implementation accordingly."

### "We just bought [Competitor]"

**Response Framework:**
"That's great that you're investing in [specific area]. Scout and Finch actually complement [Competitor] by [specific differentiation]. [Library X] uses both and finds they serve different needs. When does your contract renewal come up? We could time a pilot to help inform that decision."

### "Send me information"

**Response Framework:**
"I'd be happy to send relevant information. To make sure I send what's most useful - are you most interested in patron discovery, staff efficiency, or both? And what's your timeline for making improvements in this area?"

[Wait for answer, then...]

"Based on what you've shared, I'll send our [specific resource]. Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call to make sure I'm addressing your specific situation?"

### "We need board approval"

**Response Framework:**
"Absolutely, board buy-in is critical. We support that process in three ways:
1. ROI documentation specific to your library
2. Reference calls with peer libraries
3. We can present directly to your board if helpful

When is your next board meeting? We can time everything to support that."
