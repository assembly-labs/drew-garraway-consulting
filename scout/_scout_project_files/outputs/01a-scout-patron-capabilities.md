# Scout: AI-Powered Patron Discovery Assistant
*Helping Every Patron Find Their Next Great Read in Seconds*

---

## Executive Summary

Scout is a conversational discovery assistant that helps library patrons find exactly what they're looking for across your entire collection - physical books, ebooks, audiobooks, and databases - using natural language. Instead of navigating multiple catalogs and platforms, patrons simply describe what they want, and Scout delivers personalized recommendations in under 3 seconds.

**The Problem Scout Solves:**
- Many patrons struggle with traditional library catalogs and complex search interfaces
- Significant portions of digital collections and "library of things" go undiscovered
- Patrons must search across multiple disconnected systems
- Reference desks overwhelmed with basic discovery questions

**Scout's Intended Impact:**
- Increased patron engagement with library materials
- Reduction in basic reference desk questions
- Better discovery of underutilized collection items
- Faster, more successful patron searches

## Core Product Capabilities

### 1. Natural Language Conversational Search
**What It Is:** Patrons describe what they want in their own words - no library jargon required.

**How It Works:**
- Patron types or speaks: "I need something funny for my beach vacation"
- Scout understands intent and context
- Returns relevant results across all formats in seconds
- Provides recommendations to explore more library materials to complement, enhance, and elevate their knowledge discovery needs

**Real Patron Examples:**
- "Books like Educated but maybe not so heavy"
- "Mystery audiobooks good for a road trip"
- "Something my 8-year-old who loves dinosaurs would enjoy"
- "Large print romances without too much drama"

**Why This Matters:** Eliminates the barrier of learning Boolean searches, subject headings, or navigating complex catalog interfaces.

### 2. Unified Cross-Platform Discovery
**What It Is:** One search across everything - ILS catalog, OverDrive, Hoopla, and library databases.

**Scope of Search:**
- Physical collection (books, DVDs, audiobooks)
- OverDrive/Libby ebooks and digital audiobooks
- Hoopla streaming content
- Database articles and resources
- Special collections and local history

**Speed:** Results from all platforms in <3 seconds

**Why This Matters:** Patrons no longer miss materials because they didn't know to search multiple systems. Your $50K-$200K investment in digital content finally gets discovered.

### 3. Format-Intelligent Availability Display
**What It Is:** Shows real-time availability across all formats with hold information.

**Information Displayed:**
- Available now vs. waitlist status
- Number of holds and estimated wait time
- All available formats (book, ebook, audiobook, large print, DVD, and not traditional materials)
- Direct links to place holds or borrow digitally

**Smart Features:**
- "Also available as..." suggestions when physical book has long waitlist
- Format preferences learning ("prefers audiobooks")

**Why This Matters:** Patrons discover formats they didn't know existed, reducing frustration when their preferred format has a waitlist.

### 4. Personalized "Read-Alike" Recommendations
**What It Is:** Intelligent suggestions based on what patrons actually enjoy, with explanations.

**How It Works:**
- Patron: "I loved Where the Crawdads Sing"
- Scout: "You might enjoy The Great Alone by Kristin Hannah - both feature strong female protagonists overcoming isolation in natural settings"

**Recommendation Sources:**
- Reading history patterns (with permission)
- Professional review sources
- Library staff picks integration
- Community reading trends

**Why This Matters:** Moves beyond "customers who bought X also bought Y" to meaningful connections that help patrons discover their next favorite author.

### 5. Multi-Turn Conversational Memory
**What It Is:** Scout remembers context throughout the conversation, allowing natural refinement.

**Conversation Example:**
- Patron: "I want a good mystery"
- Scout: [Shows 10 mysteries]
- Patron: "Something more recent"
- Scout: [Filters to last 2 years]
- Patron: "Any of these available as audiobooks?"
- Scout: [Shows 3 available audiobook options]

**Context Retained:**
- Previous searches in session
- Refinement preferences
- Format preferences
- Availability requirements

**Why This Matters:** Patrons can explore naturally without starting over each time they want to adjust their search.

### 6. Voice-First Accessibility Interface
**What It Is:** Complete voice control for patrons who can't or prefer not to type.

**Accessibility Features:**
- Speech-to-text input in 12 languages
- Text-to-speech responses
- Screen reader optimized (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver tested)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode
- Adjustable text size (up to 200%)
- Simplified mode for cognitive accessibility

**WCAG 2.2 AA Certified** - Exceeds ADA Title II requirements (compliance deadline 2-3 years)

**Why This Matters:** Serves aging populations, visually impaired patrons, and those with mobility challenges who are often excluded from digital services.

### 7. Privacy-Preserving Architecture
**What It Is:** Zero patron data logging - searches are never stored or analyzed.

**Privacy Features:**
- No query history retained
- Anonymous session IDs (24-hour expiration)
- No tracking cookies beyond essential session
- No third-party data sharing
- No behavioral profiling
- Independently audited for compliance

**Alignment:**
- ALA Library Bill of Rights Article VII
- State privacy laws (CCPA, COPPA)
- FERPA compliant for school libraries

**Why This Matters:** Protects intellectual freedom and patron privacy - core library values that commercial platforms ignore.

### 8. Mobile-Responsive Experience
**What It Is:** Seamless experience across all devices patrons use.

**Supported Devices:**
- Smartphones (iOS/Android)
- Tablets
- Desktop computers
- Library catalog kiosks
- Assistive technology devices

**Features:**
- Session transfer between devices
- Offline mode for saved lists
- SMS option for hold notifications

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is Scout different from ChatGPT or other AI tools?**
A: Scout is purpose-built for libraries with zero data logging, catalog integration, and library-specific training. ChatGPT can't access your catalog, doesn't understand library materials, and stores user data.

**Q: What happens when Scout doesn't understand a query?**
A: Scout gracefully acknowledges uncertainty and offers to connect the patron with a librarian, preserving the conversation context for handoff.

**Q: Can we customize Scout's responses and recommendations?**
A: Yes. Libraries can add staff picks, local author highlights, and program promotions. Scout learns your collection's strengths and patron preferences over time.

**Q: How do we measure success?**
A: Comprehensive analytics dashboard shows search success rates, popular queries (anonymized), circulation impact, and peak usage times. Monthly reports demonstrate ROI.

**Q: What if our ILS isn't supported yet?**
A: We can work with any system that has an API or data export. Custom integrations typically take 4-6 weeks and we cover development costs for pilot libraries.
