Next steps we discussed:

2. Review with [IT person if mentioned]
3. I'll follow up on [day] to answer questions

Remember: We only have [X] cohort spots remaining, and [Nearby Library] is making their decision this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information for your internal discussions.

Best,
Drew

Subject: Quick question about [Library Name]'s timeline

Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in after our demo on [day].

Have you had a chance to discuss Scout with your team? Any questions coming up that I can address?

Also, [Other Library in their state] just confirmed their cohort spot yesterday, so we're down to [X] spots remaining.

If it helps, I'm happy to:
- Join a call with your team
- Provide references from current users
- Create a custom ROI analysis for your board

What would be most helpful?

Hi [Name],

Quick update on our Librarian Cohort:

✓ [Library 1] - Confirmed
✓ [Library 2] - Confirmed

⏳ [X] spots remaining

I wanted to make sure [Library Name] has the opportunity to join if you're interested.

Where are you in your decision process? Any concerns I can address?

If you need more time, I can tentatively hold a spot for [Library Name] until [date].

CREATING URGENCY (Day 10)

Subject: Holding [Library Name]'s cohort spot until Friday

Hi [Name],

I have one library ready to take the last cohort spot, but wanted to give [Library Name] final consideration since we spoke first.

Can you let me know by Friday if you'd like to move forward?

If you're interested but need more time for approvals, I can work with that. I just need to know your intent.

Quick reminder of what you get:
- Scout FREE for 12 months ($10,000 value)
- Finch for just $2,995 if desired
- Monthly peer collaboration
- Founding library recognition

Should I hold the spot for [Library Name]?

If not now: I'll add you to our wait list for the next cohort (likely Fall 2025).

If you need a different timeline: Let me know what works better.

I've genuinely enjoyed learning about [Library Name] and hope we can work together.

Please let me know by end of day tomorrow?

Subject: Staying in touch - Scout updates for [Library Name]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for letting me know the timing isn't right for [Library Name] to join our cohort.

I completely understand [reason they gave - budget/timing/priorities].

I'll keep you updated on Scout's progress and will reach out when:

- We have case studies from similar libraries
- Pricing or features change significantly

In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have questions.

Best of luck with [specific initiative they mentioned]!

Drew

P.S. Would you prefer quarterly updates or just major announcements?
