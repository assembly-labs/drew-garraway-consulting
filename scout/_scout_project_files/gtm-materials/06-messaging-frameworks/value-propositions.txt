COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

"Includes staff tools, not just patron features"

==============================================
URGENCY CREATORS
==============================================
Scarcity:
"Only 8 cohort spots available nationally"
"3 spots remaining as of [date]"
"[Nearby library] just claimed their spot"

Timing:
"Free for 12 months if you join now"
"Price increases to $15,995 after cohort"
"Founders pricing ends [date]"

Social Proof:
"Join Tredyffrin and 7 other innovative libraries"
"Libraries in 5 states already committed"
"Building the future with forward-thinking libraries"

==============================================
OBJECTION HANDLERS
==============================================
"It's too good to be true":
"I understand the skepticism. We're offering it free because we want library input to build the best product possible. Think of it as being paid in feedback rather than dollars."

"We don't have budget":
"That's exactly why we're offering Scout free for a year. You can prove the value before asking for budget. And at $12,995 after that, it's less than 30% of what you'd spend elsewhere."

"Staff will resist":
"Actually, staff love tools that make their jobs easier. Finch doesn't replace librarians - it handles the repetitive questions so they can do the work they trained for."

"We just bought something else":
"Great! Scout and Finch complement other tools. When does that contract renew? We can time our pilot to help inform that decision."

"It's too complex":
"Implementation takes just 2 weeks and requires no IT involvement. If your patrons can use Google, they can use Scout. No training needed."

==============================================
ELEVATOR PITCHES
==============================================
30-Second Version:
"Scout gives library patrons Google-quality search across all your collections - physical and digital. Patrons just type what they want in plain English. We're offering it FREE for a year to 8 libraries who'll help us perfect it for the library market. Interested?"

60-Second Version:
"Libraries invest millions in collections that patrons can't find. Scout solves this with natural language search - patrons type 'funny beach books' and instantly see results from your catalog, OverDrive, and Hoopla. Plus, Finch helps staff with instant answers to policy questions and procedures. We're offering both tools at 70% less than BiblioCommons, and Scout is actually FREE for the first year if you join our cohort. Worth a conversation?"

2-Minute Version:
"I know your staff hears 'I can't find anything good to read' every day, despite your amazing collection. Scout solves this by letting patrons search naturally - like they do on Google. But unlike Google, Scout searches YOUR collection, maintains patron privacy, and shows all formats available.

Finch, our staff tool, is like having your most experienced librarian available 24/7 to answer procedure questions. New staff can get instant answers instead of interrupting senior staff.

We're selecting 8 libraries nationally for our founding cohort where Scout is completely free for 12 months. You'd help shape the product through monthly feedback sessions, and lock in preferential pricing after the pilot.

Libraries using similar tools pay $30,000 to $100,000. We're offering both Scout and Finch for $12,995 after the free year. Can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss?"
