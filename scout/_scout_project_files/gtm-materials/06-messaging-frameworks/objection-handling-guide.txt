COMPLETE OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE

==============================================
BUDGET OBJECTIONS
==============================================
"We don't have budget this year"
Response: "That's exactly why Scout is FREE for the first year. You can prove the value and budget for year two. Plus, at $12,995, it's less than hiring a part-time assistant."

"We need board approval for any expense"
Response: "Understood. Even for a free pilot? Many libraries use the free year to gather data for board presentations. I can provide a board-ready deck if that helps."

"$12,995 seems expensive"
Response: "I understand price sensitivity. Consider that BiblioCommons charges $30,000-$100,000 for just discovery. We include both patron AND staff tools for 70% less. Our ROI calculator shows most libraries save the full cost in staff time within 6 months."

"We're in a budget freeze"
Response: "Perfect timing actually - Scout is free for the first year. By the time you need budget, you'll have a full year of metrics showing the value. Should we reserve your spot?"

==============================================
TIMING OBJECTIONS
==============================================
"We're too busy right now"
Response: "I hear that from every library - there's never a perfect time. That's why we handle all the implementation. It takes just 2 hours of your time total over 2 weeks. Would next month be better?"

"We just implemented [other system]"
Response: "Great! Scout and Finch actually complement [system] nicely. [Other library] uses both. When does that contract renew? We could time our pilot to inform that decision."

"Maybe next year"
Response: "I understand. Just so you know, this free cohort won't be offered again. Next year, Scout will be $12,995 from day one. Would you like me to check back in 6 months, or should we grab a free spot now while available?"

"We need to finish [project] first"
Response: "Makes sense to focus on [project]. Our implementation is so lightweight, many libraries run both simultaneously. But if you prefer to wait, should I hold a cohort spot until [project] is done?"

==============================================
TECHNOLOGY CONCERNS
==============================================
"Our staff isn't tech-savvy"
Response: "That's exactly who we designed this for. If your staff can use Google, they can use Scout and Finch. No training required. Plus, that's the beauty of the free pilot - you can test it with zero risk."

"We're worried about AI replacing staff"
Response: "I hear this a lot. Scout and Finch augment staff, not replace them. They handle repetitive questions so librarians can focus on programming, complex reference, and community engagement - the things that require human expertise."

"What about patron privacy?"
Response: "Privacy is our core value. We never log patron searches, no cookies, no tracking. We're actually more private than your current catalog system. I can share our privacy audit if helpful."

"Integration sounds complex"
Response: "It's actually simpler than adding a new database. We just need read-only API access to your ILS. Takes our team 2-3 days, and requires maybe 30 minutes from your IT person. We handle everything else."

==============================================
DECISION PROCESS OBJECTIONS
==============================================
"I need to discuss with my team"
Response: "Absolutely! Would it help if I joined a call to answer questions directly? Also, I should mention we only have [X] spots left, so let me know if you'd like me to tentatively hold one while you discuss."

"We need board approval"
Response: "Understood. I can provide a board presentation template and ROI calculations. When's your next board meeting? We can time everything to support that."

"I need to see references"
Response: "Of course! I can connect you with [similar library]. Also, since this is free for a year, you could be your own reference. What specific concerns would references address?"

"Send me information to review"
Response: "Happy to! To make sure I send the most relevant info - are you most concerned about patron features, staff benefits, or implementation? Also, would a quick 15-minute demo be more efficient than reading materials?"

==============================================
COMPETITION OBJECTIONS
==============================================
"We're happy with our current system"
Response: "That's great! Most of our libraries keep their existing systems. Scout and Finch add capabilities rather than replace. What specific gaps do you still have that your current system doesn't address?"

"We're looking at BiblioCommons"
Response: "Good choice for discovery, though expensive at $30K-$100K. Scout provides similar discovery PLUS staff tools for 70% less. Why not try our free pilot while evaluating? You'll have real data for comparison."

"We use ChatGPT already"
Response: "Smart! But ChatGPT can't search your catalog, doesn't know your procedures, and logs all queries. Scout and Finch are purpose-built for libraries with integration and privacy built in. Worth seeing the difference?"

==============================================
TRUST/CREDIBILITY OBJECTIONS
==============================================
"You're a new company"
Response: "True, which is why we're being so generous with the free pilot. You get to evaluate us for a full year risk-free. Plus, being new means we're building WITH your input, not forcing you into an old system."

"What if you go out of business?"
Response: "Fair concern. That's why there's no long-term contract and you pay annually. Plus, with our lean model and growing customer base, we're already sustainable. The free year actually proves our confidence in our staying power."

"This sounds too good to be true"
Response: "I understand the skepticism! We're offering it free because we want library input to build the best product. Think of it as being paid in feedback rather than dollars. Plus, you can cancel anytime during the free year if it doesn't deliver value."

==============================================
VALUE/NEED OBJECTIONS
==============================================
"Our patrons are happy with current discovery"
Response: "That's wonderful! Though studies show 30% of digital collections go undiscovered. What if Scout could increase that usage without changing what's working? The free pilot would give you data either way."

"We don't get many discovery questions"
Response: "Interesting! That might mean patrons have given up asking. Other libraries saw searches increase 40% after implementing Scout - patrons who never asked for help started discovering materials. Worth testing?"

"Our staff handles questions fine"
Response: "I'm sure they do! But wouldn't they rather handle complex reference than repetitive 'where are the DVDs' questions? Finch frees them for the professional work they trained for."

==============================================
THE ULTIMATE OBJECTION HANDLER
==============================================
For any objection:
"I understand your concern about [objection]. Let me ask - if [objection] wasn't an issue, would Scout and Finch be valuable for [Library Name]?"

If YES: Address the specific objection
If NO: Uncover the real objection

Then: "Given that it's completely free for a year, what's the downside of trying it? You can cancel anytime if it doesn't deliver value."

==============================================
OBJECTION PREVENTION
==============================================
In initial outreach:
- Mention "free for 12 months" early
- Address "no IT burden" upfront
- Include "cancel anytime" to reduce risk
- Mention other libraries to build trust
- Keep ask small (15-minute call)

==============================================
WHEN TO WALK AWAY
==============================================
Not every library is ready. Walk away when:
- They're genuinely happy with status quo
- No budget ever (even free is too much hassle)
- Hostile to AI/technology in general
- No authority to make decisions
- Cultural mismatch with innovation

Always leave gracefully:
"I understand this isn't the right fit/time for [Library Name]. I'll keep you on our newsletter for major updates. Best of luck with [their approach/project]!"
