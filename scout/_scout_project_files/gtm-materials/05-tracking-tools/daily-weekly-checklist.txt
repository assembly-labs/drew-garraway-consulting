QUICK RESPONSE TEMPLATES
==============================================
For "Send me information":
"Happy to send information! To make sure it's relevant, are you most interested in patron discovery, staff efficiency, or both? Also, what's your timeline for improvements?"

For "Not interested":
"Thanks for letting me know! May I ask what you're currently using for patron discovery? Always looking to understand the landscape better."

For "Maybe later":
"Understood! I'll check back in [timeframe]. In the meantime, would you like to see what other libraries are doing with Scout?"

For "What's the catch?":
"Great question! We're building WITH libraries, not FOR them. Your feedback shapes the product. After the free year, it's $12,995 annually - still 70% less than BiblioCommons."
