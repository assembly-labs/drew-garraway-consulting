15-MINUTE DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT

==============================================
PURPOSE
==============================================
- Qualify the library (size, ILS, budget authority)
- Understand their pain points
- Generate interest in full demo
- Build rapport quickly

==============================================
OPENING (2 minutes)
==============================================
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking my call. I know you're busy so I'll be brief."

"I saw that [Library Name] recently [mention something specific you researched] - that's impressive."

"As I mentioned in my email, we're offering Scout FREE for 12 months to select libraries. Before we dive in, can you tell me what's your biggest challenge with helping patrons discover materials?"

[LISTEN - Take notes on specific pain points]

==============================================
BRIEF SOLUTION OVERVIEW (5 minutes)
==============================================
"That's exactly what Scout addresses..."

Scout in 30 seconds:
"Scout is like giving your patrons Google-quality search for your entire collection. They type 'funny beach books' and instantly see results from your physical books, OverDrive ebooks, and Hoopla audiobooks - all in one search."

Key Differentiator:
"Unlike other tools that cost $30K+, we're offering this FREE for a year to libraries that join our cohort."

Finch Mention:
"We also have Finch for staff - it's like ChatGPT trained on your specific procedures and policies. But let's focus on Scout first since that's free."

==============================================
QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS (3 minutes)
==============================================
Technical Fit:
"What ILS does [Library Name] use?"
[If Polaris/Koha/Sierra: "Perfect, we integrate seamlessly."]
[If other: "We can work with that - might need an extra week for setup."]

Decision Process:
"If you love what you see, what's the process for moving forward?"
"Do you need board approval for a free pilot?"

Timeline:
"When would you ideally want to launch something like this?"

Current Tools:
"Are you using any discovery layer now? BiblioCommons or similar?"

==============================================
NEXT STEPS (3 minutes)
==============================================
Generate Interest:
"Based on what you've shared, I think [Library Name] would be perfect for our cohort."

"Would you like to see Scout in action? I can show you exactly how it would work with your catalog."

Schedule Demo:
"I have time [offer 2-3 specific slots]. What works best for you?"

"Who else should join us? IT? Other librarians?"

Set Expectations:
"The demo takes about 45 minutes. I'll show Scout, preview Finch, and explain the cohort program."

"I'll send a calendar invite with a brief agenda."

==============================================
IF THEY'RE NOT READY FOR DEMO
==============================================
Stay Connected:
"No problem. Would you like me to send some information you can review first?"

"I'll include:
- One-page overview
- ROI calculator
- Cohort details"

Create FOMO:
"Just so you know, we only have [X] spots left and strong interest from [mention nearby libraries]."

Follow-Up:
"I'll check back in a week to see if you have questions. Sound good?"

==============================================
CLOSING (2 minutes)
==============================================
Enthusiastic:
"I'm excited about the possibility of [Library Name] joining our cohort."

Urgency:
"We're making final selections by [date], so the sooner we can connect, the better."

Appreciation:
"Thanks for your time today. I'll send that [demo invite/information] right after our call."

"Any quick questions before we wrap up?"
