EMAIL TEMPLATE - INNOVATION ANGLE (CA/MA/CO LIBRARIES):

Hi [Director First Name],

[Competitor Library] just reported a 40% increase in catalog searches after implementing AI-powered discovery. But they paid $30K+ for BiblioCommons.

What if you could deliver even better patron discovery for FREE?

I'm selecting 8 innovative libraries nationally for our Librarian Cohort:
• Scout (patron AI) FREE for 12 months
• Optional Finch (staff AI) for just $2,995
• Monthly collaboration with peer libraries
• Direct input into product development

[Library Name]'s recent [grant/initiative/program] shows you're exactly the kind of forward-thinking library we want to partner with.

Can we schedule a 15-minute call this week? Here's my calendar: [calendly link]

Best,
Drew

P.S. We already have libraries from [list 2-3 states] in the cohort - would love [State] representation.
