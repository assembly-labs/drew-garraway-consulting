Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Just circling back on my previous note about Scout's free 12-month pilot for [Library Name].

We now have just [X] spots left in the Librarian Cohort, with strong interest from [Nearby Library] and [Other Library].

Even if the timing isn't right, I'd value your quick feedback on what would make this valuable for [Library Name].

Still worth a brief chat?

Subject: Final cohort spots - [Library Name]

Hi [Name],

I wanted to give [Library Name] one last opportunity to join our Librarian Cohort before we finalize the group.

We're down to our final 2 spots, and I'll need to make decisions by [Date].

If you're interested, here's my calendar: [link]

If not, I'd appreciate a quick "not interested" reply so I can offer your spot to another library.

Thanks either way!

Subject: Should I stop reaching out?

Hi [Name],

I've sent a few emails about Scout's free pilot program for [Library Name], but haven't heard back.

I realize you're incredibly busy, and this might not be a priority right now.

I'm going to assume the timing isn't right and stop reaching out. If things change and you'd like to explore AI-powered discovery for your patrons, I'm always here.

Best of luck with everything at [Library Name]!

Drew

P.S. I'll be sending occasional updates about Scout's progress. Let me know if you'd prefer not to receive these.
