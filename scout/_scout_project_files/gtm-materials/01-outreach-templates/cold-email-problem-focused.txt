Hi [Director First Name],

How many times a day do your staff hear "I can't find anything good to read"?

Scout solves this with natural language search across your entire collection. Patrons just type "funny books for vacation" or "mysteries like Louise Penny" and get instant recommendations from your physical AND digital collections.

I have 3 spots left in our Librarian Cohort where Scout is FREE for 12 months.

The catch? We're looking for libraries to provide monthly feedback as we refine the product specifically for public libraries.

Worth a quick chat? Even a 15-minute call could be valuable.

Best,
Drew

P.S. [Library Name] has [X]% of your collection in digital formats - Scout makes sure patrons actually discover these materials.
