EMAIL TEMPLATE - LOCAL ANGLE (PA/DE LIBRARIES):

Hi [Director First Name],

I'm Drew, based here in Philadelphia, working on something I think could really help [Library Name].

We're launching Scout - an AI discovery assistant that helps patrons find materials across your physical and digital collections using natural language. Think "Google for your library catalog" but with privacy protection.

I'm selecting 8 libraries for our founding Librarian Cohort, where Scout is completely FREE for 12 months (normally $10K value). Tredyffrin Library just joined.

Given [Library Name]'s innovative approach to [specific program/initiative you researched], you'd be perfect for this cohort.

Worth a 15-minute call to discuss? I can even meet in person - you're only [X] miles away.

Best,
Drew

P.S. As a local company, we provide hands-on implementation support to our Greater Philadelphia libraries at no extra cost.
