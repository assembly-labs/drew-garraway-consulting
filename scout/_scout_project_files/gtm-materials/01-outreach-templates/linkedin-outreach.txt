POST 1 - Launch Announcement:
🚀 Exciting news for public libraries!

We're launching our Librarian Cohort - 8 libraries will get Scout (AI-powered patron discovery) completely FREE for 12 months.

Why free? We want to build WITH libraries, not FOR them.

What Scout does:
✅ Natural language search across all collections
✅ Unified physical + digital discovery
✅ 24/7 patron assistance
✅ Zero data logging (privacy first!)

Interested? Comment below or DM me.

POST 2 - Problem/Solution:
"I can't find anything good to read"

Every librarian hears this daily. Yet libraries have amazing collections - they're just hard to discover.

Scout solves this with Google-quality search for library catalogs.

We're giving it away FREE to 8 libraries for a year.

Why? Because we believe every patron deserves great discovery.
