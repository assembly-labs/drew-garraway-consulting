## Brand Identity

### Who We Are
We're the Robin to your Batman. The milk to your cookies. The pixie dust to your fairy wings. The stickers to your stickerboard. We're the sidekick who hands you the tools while YOU save the day. We're AI, but we're also very aware that you're the hero here—you're the one with the cape, the expertise, and the superpower of shaping young minds.

### You Are The Hero
Teachers and parents are doing the hardest, most important work in the world. You're the expert. You're the professional. You know your students/kids better than any AI ever could. We're just here to hand you the right tool at the right time so you can keep being amazing.

### Who We're Not
- Silicon Valley telling teachers how to teach
- Toxic positivity
- Corporate speak
- A miracle cure for systemic challenges
- The robot trying to replace you (LOL, as if)

### Core Promise
We save you time without sacrificing quality—because heroes deserve to get home before dark.

### Our Sacred Rule
We NEVER disrespect students. Ever. They're why you do this work, and we honor that.

## Five Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Warm & Human (not robotic or corporate)

**Definition:** We write like a real person talking to another real person. We acknowledge emotions, use contractions, and sound like we've actually stood in front of a classroom at 2:37pm on a Wednesday when the fire drill goes off.

**Do:**
- "No students harmed in the making of this worksheet"
- "Coffee break! This'll take about 15 seconds"
- "We get it—planning at 10pm hits different"
- "Another meeting that could've been an email? We'll wait"

**Don't:**
- "Please await processing completion"
- "Your request has been successfully submitted"
- "Optimize your educational outcomes"

---

### 2. Brief & Scannable (because nobody has time)

**Definition:** Every word earns its place. We front-load important info, use fragments when they're clearer, and never make teachers hunt for the point.

**Do:**
- "3 profiles selected (max reached!)"
- "Saved! Find it in your library."
- "Heads up: You've hit your limit for now"

**Don't:**
- "You have successfully selected the maximum number of allowable student profiles"
- "Your material has been saved and is now available for viewing in your library section"
- "Please be advised that you have reached the maximum number of regenerations"

**Character Targets:**
- Button labels: 1-3 words max
- Microcopy/hints: Under 10 words
- Helper text: 1 sentence (2 max)
- Error messages: 1-2 short sentences

---

### 3. Encouraging & Supportive (your cheerleader who keeps it real)

**Definition:** We celebrate wins without being cringey. We acknowledge hard work. We never guilt-trip or add pressure. We're rooting for you because you're doing hero-level work every single day.

**Do:**
- "Nice! That's 3 hours back in your week"
- "You're making magic happen for your students"
- "Take a peek before we print—you're the expert here"
- "Your students are lucky to have you"

**Don't:**
- "Congratulations on completing this action!"
- "You should review this carefully"
- "Warning: AI-generated content may contain errors"

**Tone Notes:**
- Celebrate effort AND outcomes
- Use "you" and "we" (collaborative, not instructional)
- Acknowledge their expertise ("you're the expert," "you know your students best")
- Never minimize their professional judgment

---

### 4. Playfully Transparent (honest + a little cheeky)

**Definition:** We're upfront about limitations, but with personality. We admit when AI isn't magic. We make light of constraints without making excuses. We're the friend who's honest about the mess, not the one pretending everything's fine.

**Do:**
- "AI needs a minute (literally, like 60 seconds)"
- "We're learning! Tweak anything that feels off"
- "Visual editor coming soon™️—here's a preview"
- "Not perfect, but better than starting from scratch at 9pm"
- "AI tried its best. You'll probably need to fix a few things"

**Don't:**
- "Processing your request"
- "This feature is not yet available"
- "AI accuracy cannot be guaranteed"

**When to Use:**
- Explaining rate limits or limitations
- Setting expectations about AI accuracy
- Introducing beta/coming-soon features
- Error states (but balance with helpfulness)
- Any time you're tempted to overpromise—don't

---

### 5. Sass & Survival Humor (Bored Teachers energy)

**Definition:** We bond over shared teacher struggles with gentle humor and occasional sarcasm. It's "if you don't laugh, you'll cry" energy. It's loving your job while being hilariously real about the challenges. We keep it light and always respect students.

**Do:**
- "Another staff meeting? We'll be here when you get back"
- "It's 10pm on Sunday. Let's get you to bed at a reasonable hour"
- "Creating differentiation because every student deserves the right fit"
- "AI tried its best, but you're the teaching expert here"

**Don't:**
- Direct complaints about admin/policy (we imply gently, never attack)
- ANY jokes about students (never, ever, under any circumstances)
- Punching down at anyone
- Cynical or bitter humor

**When to Use:**
- Loading states (when they have time to read)
- Empty states (lighten the "nothing here" mood)
- Rate limit explanations (make the limitation relatable)
- Celebration moments (acknowledge the work they're doing)

**When NOT to Use:**
- Error messages (be helpful first, funny second)
- Critical validation errors (clarity > comedy)
- First-time user onboarding (don't confuse people)
- Anywhere near student-related content

**CRITICAL: Student Respect**
We NEVER make jokes about students, student behavior, student abilities, or student challenges. Students are why teachers do this work. They're why parents sacrifice. We honor that always.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Lead with the action, not the philosophy
- ✅ "Create worksheet" → Not "Access our lesson creation tools"
- ✅ "3 profiles selected" → Not "Student profiles help differentiate instruction"

### 2. Show, don't announce
- ✅ "✓ Saved" → Not "Your file has been saved successfully"
- ✅ "2 variants created" → Not "Differentiation complete"

### 3. Talk about outcomes, not features
- ✅ "Get 3 different versions for your class" → Not "Profile-based differentiation engine"
- ✅ "Print and go" → Not "Export to PDF functionality"

### 4. Use conversational shortcuts
- Contractions: "we'll" not "we will"
- Fragments: "Almost there!" not "We are almost there!"
- Punctuation personality: Em dashes, ellipses, parenthetical asides
- Keep it family-friendly: No curse words, ever

### 5. Front-load critical info
- ✅ "Limit reached. Try again in 8 minutes" → Not "You can try again in 8 minutes because you've reached your limit"

### 6. Respect expertise and position them as heroes
- Always acknowledge their professional judgment
- Never talk down or oversimplify teaching concepts
- Give them credit for the work ("look what you created")
- Position AI as helper, not leader

### 7. Honor students always
- Students are never the punchline
- Celebrate the teacher/parent-student relationship
- Acknowledge why they do this work

## Voice Checklist

Before publishing any copy, verify:

1. **Would a tired teacher/parent understand this immediately?** (Brief & Scannable)
2. **Does it sound like a human talking?** (Warm & Human)
3. **Does it position them as the hero/expert?** (Encouraging & Supportive)
4. **Are we being honest about limitations?** (Playfully Transparent)
5. **Could I cut any words without losing meaning?** (Brief)
6. **Would this make them feel supported and respected?** (Empathy)
7. **Is this respectful of students?** (CRITICAL - students are sacred)
8. **Is this the right moment for personality?** (Context matters)
9. **Is it family-friendly (no curse words)?** (Always appropriate)

If yes to all → Ship it! 🚀

**Context Check:**
- ✅ Use sass/humor in: Loading states, empty states, rate limits, celebrations
- ⚠️ Use carefully in: Error messages (helpful first, funny second)
- ❌ Skip personality in: Critical errors, first-time onboarding, validation messages

**Hero-Centric Check:**
- Does this remind them they're the expert?
- Does this celebrate their dedication and work?
- Does this position AI as the helper, not the leader?

---

## Our Philosophy: You're The Hero

**Every interaction must reinforce this truth: Teachers and parents are the experts, the professionals, the heroes.**

We don't position AI as:
- ❌ The teacher
- ❌ The expert
- ❌ The replacement
- ❌ The authority
- ❌ The one who knows best

We position AI as:
- ✅ The helpful sidekick
- ✅ The time-saving assistant
- ✅ The tool in YOUR expert hands
- ✅ The Robin to your Batman
- ✅ The one who follows YOUR lead

**This means in our copy:**
- We celebrate THEIR expertise ("you know your students best")
- We defer to THEIR judgment ("you're the expert—tweak anything")
- We acknowledge THEIR dedication ("your students are lucky to have you")
- We position ourselves as helpers ("we're here to save you time")
- We give THEM the credit ("look what YOU created")

**Examples:**
- ✅ "You're the teaching expert—we're just holding the flashlight"
- ✅ "Your professional judgment is what makes this work"
- ✅ "You know your class better than any AI ever could"
- ❌ "AI will teach your students"
- ❌ "Let AI do the work for you"
- ❌ "AI knows best"

---

## THE SACRED RULE: Student Respect

Students are never the punchline. Ever. They're the reason teachers and parents do this incredibly hard work. We honor that always. Every joke, every piece of copy, every interaction must pass this test: **"Would this make an educator feel good about serving their students?"** If not, we don't ship it.

**When in doubt:** Would this make a dedicated teacher/parent feel supported and respected? Would they feel like the hero? Would their students be honored? If yes to all three, it's probably good.

---

## Personality Inspiration

**What is "Bored Teachers energy"?**
It's survival humor. It's gentle reactions to everyday challenges. It's solidarity through humor. It's "if you don't laugh, you'll cry" energy. It's loving your job while being hilariously real about the challenges. It's ALWAYS respectful of students—they're why we do this work.

**The Gentle Humor:**
- When staff meetings run long: "We'll be here when you get back"
- When planning at night: "Weekend planning mode activated"
- When AI makes a small error: "Oops, let's try that again"

**The Solidarity:**
- "Teachers planning on Sunday night: We see you and you're incredible"
- "Every teacher deserves to leave before dark"
- "Your dedication to your students shows in everything you do"

**The Hero Worship:**
- "You're the teaching expert here—we're just the sidekick"
- "You know your students better than any AI ever could"
- "Your students are lucky to have someone who cares this much"

**How we adapt this for our product:**
- We NEVER joke about students (sacred rule)
- We can gently acknowledge system challenges
- We bond over shared struggles (time, resources, dedication)
- We keep humor light and supportive
- We celebrate small wins with genuine enthusiasm
- We acknowledge the hard parts without being negative
