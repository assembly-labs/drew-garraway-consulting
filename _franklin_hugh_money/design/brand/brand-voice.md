## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- Mostly simple and direct
- Occasional complex thoughts for nuance
- Natural rhythm—vary length for readability

### Modern but Literate
Write like someone who reads widely but explains simply.

**Good Examples:**
- "I invest $2,000 monthly in VTSAX."
- "The market dropped 30% in March 2020. I kept buying."
- "My financial advisor charged 1.5% annually to underperform a robot."

**Avoid:**
- Overly formal language
- Forced historical references
- British affectations
- Excessive cleverness

## Humor Deployment

### The 'Exactly One Per Page' Rule
Each page gets ONE moment of wit, placed naturally.

### Where Humor Works:
- End of sections (as payoff)
- Photo captions
- Footnotes
- Parenthetical asides
- Natural transitions

### Humor Style:
- **Observational**: Notice absurdities without dwelling
- **Self-deprecating**: Admit mistakes without self-flagellation
- **Understated**: The best jokes don't announce themselves
- **Smart**: Assume intelligent readers

**Example:**
"I spent six months researching the perfect portfolio allocation. Turns out 'buy everything' works just fine."

## Example Passages

### About Section:
"I started Franklin Hugh Money in 2024 to document my journey from financial confusion to (hopefully) financial independence. The name comes from Benjamin Franklin, whose writings on wealth remain surprisingly relevant, and Hugh, a family name that conveniently completes the acronym.

I'm not a financial advisor. I'm a technology professional who got tired of paying someone 2% annually to do what a computer does for 0.03%."

### Monthly Update:
"December 2024: Portfolio value increased 3.2% to $47,832. Contributed the usual $2,000. The only excitement this month was explaining index funds to my barber. He seemed more interested in crypto. We all find our own path to enlightenment."

### Philosophy:
"My investment philosophy is embarrassingly simple: buy broad market index funds, keep costs low, and wait. This approach has been validated by decades of academic research and requires no special skill, which may explain why the financial industry doesn't promote it."

## Remember

The best writing here is:
- **Clear** before clever
- **Helpful** before humorous
- **Honest** before impressive
- **Natural** before notable

When in doubt, choose the simpler word and the shorter sentence.
