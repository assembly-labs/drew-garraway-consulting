## "F.U. Money - Building Wealth with Rebellion"

## 🎸 The Mission

Franklin Hugh Money exists to document one man's journey from financial ignorance to expertise, with all the punk rock attitude that Wall Street hates.

This isn't another "get rich quick" scheme or boring finance blog. This is raw, honest documentation of building wealth while giving the middle finger to traditional financial "wisdom."
