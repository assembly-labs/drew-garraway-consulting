# Chapter 5: Municipal Debt and Money Market Instruments
## Section 1: Municipal Debt

### Introduction to Municipal Debt

The major benefit of municipal debt is the preferential tax treatment typically given to the interest income generated. Municipal debt obligations are issued by state and local governments, as well as various regional authorities, to finance their operations. Examples of municipal issuers include:

- Counties
- Parishes
- Cities
- Towns
- Boroughs
- Water, sewer, and school districts, and transportation authorities

### Key Concepts

After reading this section, you should be familiar with the following topics:

- Municipal Debt Characteristics
- General Obligation (GO) Bonds
- Revenue Bonds
- Special Types of Muni Debt
- Short-Term Muni Debt
- Municipal Debt Trading
- Municipal Debt Tax Status

## Topic 1: Municipal Debt Characteristics

Municipal securities are exempt from federal regulations. However, a self-regulatory body, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), regulates broker-dealers and advisers who deal in municipal securities, but it has no authority over municipal issuers, which are self-governing.

Because municipal securities are exempt from registration, issuers do not have to publish a prospectus, which is a detailed disclosure document required of most issuers of securities. Instead, they offer a less detailed disclosure document called an **official statement**. This document contains information about the bonds and the financial condition of the issuer. Firms that sell municipal securities are required to give their customers copies of the official statement by the confirmation of the trade.

### Legal Opinion

All municipal issues have a **legal opinion**. The legal opinion tells the investor that the municipality is authorized to sell the bonds. To get this opinion, the municipality issuing the securities will retain a law firm to act as **bond counsel** and examine the issue to make sure of its:

- **Legality**: It is legally binding on the issuer.
- **Validity**: Fully authorized and issued by municipality.
- **Tax-exempt status**: The interest is exempt from federal tax under current law.

The bond counsel prepares all the legal documentation necessary for the issue including the legal opinion. There are two types of legal opinions that can be given:

- **Qualified**: The opinion will be qualified if the counsel finds a problem. The qualifier will state that there is a legal uncertainty of which any purchaser should be aware. For example, new federal tax rulings may make the interest taxable.
- **Unqualified**: The bond counsel determines that they have found no problems with the issue.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: Issuers want an unqualified legal opinion because this means there are no outstanding legal issues associated with the issue.

### Bond Contract

In addition to a legal opinion, all municipal bonds are issued under a **bond contract** prepared by the bond counsel. The contract consists of various pieces, depending on the type of issue. Every bond contract has:

- An authorizing resolution, known as a **bond resolution**, which allows the sale of the securities
- A security agreement pledging an income source to back the issue, such as full faith, credit, and taxing power for a GO bond or specified revenues for a revenue bond

### Municipal Debt Maturities

Municipal debt maturities can be either long-term debt or short-term notes. Most long-term issues are serial bonds with maturities spread over a sequence of years. These bonds are issued at par and pay interest semiannually.

Short-term notes can be issued in two ways:

- At a discount to par, which matures at par value
- At par, which matures at par plus accrued interest

### Characteristics of Municipal Bonds

- Interest income not taxed at the federal level
- Exempt from registration, but not from anti-fraud requirements
- Come with an official statement instead of a prospectus
- Good for investors in higher tax brackets
- Typically, lower yields than corporate bonds, but higher than Treasuries
- Typically, less risky than corporate bonds
- Good for portfolio diversification

Municipal issues are broadly categorized into general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, special types of bonds, and short-term notes.

## Topic 2: General Obligation (GO) Bonds

A **general obligation bond (GO bond)** is backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuer. GO bonds are typically backed by tax revenue. The type of tax that backs GO bonds depends on the issuing entity. Local governments can collect property taxes, known as ad valorem taxes. Local governmental issues are usually backed by unlimited ad valorem taxes. This means that the municipality promises to raise taxes, without any limit, to pay off the bondholders.

In some cases, issuers will sell **limited tax bonds**. This means that there is a limit placed on the rate that the issuer is allowed to assess. The bondholders would be at risk if the issuer is not collecting enough taxes to service the debt. As a result, limited tax bonds have more credit risk than unlimited tax bonds and sell at higher interest rates.

Many municipalities also have imposed a **statutory debt limit** on the dollar amount of GO bonds that can be outstanding at any one time. In this case, a municipality cannot issue additional GO bonds if it is already at its debt limit. The only way to change the maximum debt limit is through legislative action or a public referendum.

GO bondholders have the right to compel a **tax levy** or legislative appropriation to make payment on the debt in the event of a default. Because of this, GO bonds are generally considered the safest type of municipal bonds. The rating of each issuer can vary and is provided by the ratings services.

**Capital appreciation bonds (CABs)** are municipal zero-coupon bonds with a legal twist. CABs are usually sold at a deep discount to par, and only the discounted principal amount is counted against the issuer's debt limit. For this reason, CABs are good for municipalities that are close to their debt limit.

## Topic 3: Revenue Bonds

A **revenue bond** is backed by revenue from a specific source, such as a public hospital, a toll bridge, or a sports arena. Revenue bonds are not backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer and are often issued by a separate authority such as a transportation authority. Unlike GO bonds, revenue bonds do not allow the bondholders to force taxation or legislative action for payment. Revenue bonds are said to be self-supporting debt since only the specified revenues are used to back the issue. The types of revenue that back these bonds are revenues from the operation of a specific project, user fees, rents, grants, and excise and other non–ad valorem taxes.

The issuance of revenue bonds is dependent on the completion of a **feasibility study** to ensure that a proposed project makes economic sense.

### Example
A town proposes to build a new hospital and finance the project with a revenue bond issue. A feasibility study, usually undertaken by outside consultants who do not have a personal stake in seeing the facility built, will prepare a report defining the need for the facility. The feasibility report includes:

- The projected costs of running and financing the facility
- The expected revenues from the facility
- An engineer's report on the costs of building the facility
- The effect of competing hospitals, etc.

The town will issue bonds if the feasibility report shows that the project is economically viable.

Revenue bonds carry higher credit risk than GO bonds because they are backed by a project that may not generate sufficient revenues to service the issued debt. The increased credit risk causes revenue bonds to trade at higher yields. Investors in revenue bonds demand greater protections than GO bond purchasers since there is no ability to collect if the project fails. Because of this, most revenue bonds are issued under a trust indenture. The creation of a **trust indenture** is a legal requirement for corporate issuers under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Municipal issues are exempt from this act. Although the use of a trust indenture is optional, revenue issues are hard to sell without one.

### General Obligation vs. Revenue Bonds

| General Obligation Bonds | Revenue Bonds |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Backed by ad valorem taxes, and by the full faith and credit of the municipality | Backed by revenues from a specific project (e.g., sports arena) |
| Issued to fund a municipality's budget | Issued to fund a specific project |
| Debt limits can apply | Debt limits do not apply |
| Typically, safer than revenue bonds | Typically, riskier than GO bonds |

## Topic 4: Special Types of Muni Debt

The two largest types of municipal offerings are GO bonds and revenue bonds. The rest of the municipal market is composed of special types of bonds.

**Special tax bonds** are issues secured by a tax other than an ad valorem tax. These bonds are usually secured with excise taxes such as cigarette, liquor, and gasoline taxes. The tax source does not have to relate to the type of project.

**Special assessment bonds** are used to fund an improvement that does not benefit the general public. These improvements will benefit a small portion of the community. A municipality will issue bonds backed by a special assessment of increased taxes designed to pay for the improvement.

> **Example**: New streetlights or sidewalks may be put in one area, and only that area is assessed higher taxes to pay for the improvement.

**Moral obligation bonds** are backed by the promise to pay, but not the legal obligation to pay.

> **Example**:
> **The Problem**: In 1975, New York City (NYC) was above its statutory debt limit and could not legally issue more debt backed by taxing power. At that same time, NYC needed more financing to roll over existing debt or it was going to default.
>
> **The Solution**: The state of New York (NY) assumed the moral obligation to pay if the city of NY could not. NY's state legislature was authorized, but not obligated, to provide the funds needed to service the debt, if necessary.

Moral obligation bonds are typically issued in times of distress and have a higher level of credit risk.

**Double-barreled bonds** are backed by a revenue source other than ad valorem taxes, but are also backed by the faith, credit, and taxing power of a municipal issuer. For example, a highway revenue bond may be backed by toll revenue from the highway, and by the issuer's taxing power. The combined backing will improve its credit rating. This type of bond is treated as a GO bond since the ultimate source of payment is taxing power.

**Parity bonds** have an equal claim to tax collections or revenues as other outstanding obligations of that issuer.

> **Example**: A municipality has a debt limit of $500 million and has already issued $300 million of general obligation bonds. If the municipality issues another $100 million of GO bonds within its debt limit, these bonds will have the same claim on tax collections as the first $300 million issued. Since both bonds have an equal claim, they are called parity bonds.

In contrast, some issues are junior to outstanding debt obligations. In our example, if the municipality had issued the second $100 million as subordinated debt, those bonds would have a lesser claim on taxes or revenues.

**Certificates of participation (COPs)** allow a municipality to continue issuing debt despite reaching its debt limit.

> **Example**: A municipality issues a COP to build a facility such as a university dormitory, prison, or municipal office building. The municipality then leases the facility, and lease payments are distributed to investors. In other words, the purchasers of the COP provide the funds to build the facility and in turn receive the lease payments. Since the municipality is not legally obligated to fund these issues, the issues are not legally GO bonds.

**Lease rental bonds** are issues used to finance office construction where the user is a state or city agency. The rents paid by the user are the revenue source. Unlike a COP, the municipality is generally obligated to appropriate the funds for the lease payments from general tax revenues.

**Industrial development bonds (IDBs)** are issued by a state, city, or local agency to build an industrial facility that is to be leased to a private company. The lease payments of the company are the revenue source that backs the bonds.

IDBs are:
- Guaranteed by the private user
- Take on the private user's credit rating
- Considered the user's liability, not the liability of a municipal issuer

The interest on these bonds may be subject to federal and local taxes since they are ultimately used for private purposes.

**Build America bonds (BABs)** were issued in response to the Great Recession of 2008. To help with an economic recovery, municipalities could issue taxable bonds known as BABs. These bonds got a **35% interest rate credit** from the federal government.

> **Example**: A municipality issues a 10% BAB. The municipality will get a payment from the federal government equal to 3.5% (35% of 10%). This makes the municipality's net interest cost 6.5% (10.0% − 3.5%).

The BAB program ran through the end of 2010. It only permitted bond issues to be sold where the proceeds would be used for infrastructure improvements. Capital projects that could be funded with BABs included:

- Public buildings
- Courthouses
- Schools
- Roads
- Public housing
- Transportation infrastructure
- Government hospitals
- Public safety facilities
- Water and sewer projects
- Environmental projects
- Public utilities

**Private activity bonds (PABs)** are taxable municipal bonds that are created to fund private activities that don't qualify for a federal tax exemption. While the interest on PABs is typically taxable at the federal level, it is often tax free at the local level and often at the state level as well.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: PABs offer higher interest rates than other tax-exempt municipal bonds because they are taxable at the federal level.

## Topic 5: Short-Term Municipal Debt

Municipalities issue short-term notes. These notes usually have maturities of less than 12 months.

Short-term municipal (muni) notes are issued for two general purposes:
- For temporary financing of capital improvements
- To even out cash flows

These short-term muni notes are usually sold at par with a stated rate of interest. They are then redeemed at par, plus accrued interest, at maturity. However, some are sold at a discount and mature at par.

Short-term muni notes can be categorized into types. The first type is often referred to as **anticipation notes**, because they are issued in anticipation of an expected source of income, like taxes, revenue, or other longer-term bonds. Anticipation notes allow a project to get underway before more permanent funding has been received. These are:

- **Bond anticipation notes (BANs)** are issued to start capital projects. The note is paid off by the time that a final long-term bond is issued. BANs are used because the ultimate final cost of the project is unknown during the construction period. Most BANs are secured by a general obligation pledge of the issuer.

- **Construction loan notes (CLNs)** are issued to start the building of multi-family housing projects. The CLN is paid off by the proceeds of a final long-term bond issue. CLNs are typically issued for periods of 2–3 years during times when interest rates are high. The issuer is hoping that interest rates will have dropped by the time the final bond is issued.

- **Tax anticipation notes (TANs)** are used when future tax income is anticipated, and a municipality wishes to use these anticipated funds before they are collected. TANs are issued in anticipation of future property (ad valorem) tax receipts and will be paid off from those receipts. TANs are secured by a general obligation pledge of the issuer.

- **Revenue anticipation notes (RANs)** are issued in anticipation of future revenue collections and tax collections other than ad valorem taxes. An income source for a RAN could be future concession fees from a sports facility. The RANs are paid off from those collections.

- **Tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs)** are issued in anticipation of both future tax collections and revenue collections. Think of TRANs as a combination of a TAN and RAN offering.

- **Grant anticipation notes (GANs)** are issued in expectation of receiving grant monies. These funds are usually from the federal government for mass transit, energy conservation, and pollution control programs.

- **Tax-exempt commercial paper** is issued with very short maturities and is backed by a bank line of credit. If the municipal issuer cannot pay, the bank is obligated to pay.

- **Variable rate demand notes** enable issuers to raise long-term financing at short-term rates. The issuer resets the interest rate daily or weekly based on a given index. On the reset date, the note holder has the option of:
  - redeeming the note at par
  - holding it for the next period at the new interest rate

Because the interest rate with variable rate demand notes can either be stepped up or stepped down at the reset date, these are sometimes referred to as **step-up** or **step-down notes** or bonds.

Unlike bonds with fixed interest rates, variable rate demand notes will show very little price fluctuation in response to market interest rate movements. However, if interest rates fall, investors will receive less income. These notes can also be callable.

## Topic 6: Municipal Debt Trading

Currently, almost all new municipal debt is issued in **book-entry form**. Municipals trade **over the counter (OTC)** rather than on an exchange and settle in one business day (T+1). Trading in municipal bonds is limited for two reasons: First, investors in municipal bonds typically use a buy-and-hold strategy and do not actively trade their portfolios. Second, investors primarily invest only in municipal bonds issued in the state in which they live, resulting in a thin market.

For example, people in Maine buy Maine bonds, not New York bonds; people in New York buy New York bonds, not Maine bonds.

Since municipal bonds are thinly traded, they generally cannot be sold short. Short selling is when an investor sells borrowed securities that they do not own.

## Topic 7: Municipal Debt Tax Status

A major advantage of investing in municipal bonds is the tax treatment afforded to them. Municipal bond interest income is **exempt** from federal income tax but may be subject to state and local tax, especially if the purchaser does not live in the issuing state.

For most issues, if the purchaser is a resident of the state of issuance, state and local governments will exempt these issues from taxation. Since municipal bond interest income is exempt from federal taxes, the issue becomes **triple tax exempt** (exempt at the local, state, and federal level).

Issues of territories or possessions of the U.S. (Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands) are always triple tax exempt, no matter where the purchaser resides.

Watch this three-minute video if you want a recap of the different taxation rules for the different types of municipal bonds.

### Tax Status of Interest Received

| Type of Debt | Federal Tax | State Tax |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| U.S. government | Subject | Exempt |
| Government agency | Subject | Exempt |
| Privatized government agency | Subject | Subject |
| Corporate | Subject | Subject |
| Municipal | Exempt | Subject* |

*Unless the bond is purchased by a resident of the issuing state.

The interest income received from U.S. government and agency issues is subject to federal income tax but is exempt from state and local taxes. Compare this to the tax status of municipal interest income, which is exempt from federal income tax, but may be subject to state and local tax.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: Because municipal bonds are often triple tax free, they are often a good choice (suitable) for investors in high tax brackets.

**Note**: The interest income received from corporate issues is taxable at the federal, state, and local level. Interest income received from the privatized agency issuers, such as FNMA (Fannie Mae) and FHLMC (Freddie Mac), is taxed the same way. Finally, even though GNMA (Ginnie Mae) is not privatized, it is taxed in the same manner as FNMA and FHLMC.
