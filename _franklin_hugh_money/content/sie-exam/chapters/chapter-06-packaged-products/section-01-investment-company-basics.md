# Investment Company Basics

## Introduction

Before 1924, if you wanted a diversified portfolio of stocks, you needed to be wealthy. Really wealthy. The kind of wealthy where you could afford to buy meaningful positions in dozens of companies while still having enough left over for a reasonable life.

Then something remarkable happened in Boston.

The Massachusetts Investors Trust launched on March 21, 1924, becoming what most consider America's first modern mutual fund. The concept was elegantly simple: pool money from many investors, hire a professional to manage it, and suddenly the average person could own a slice of corporate America.

A century later, packaged products—mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and their cousins—hold over $30 trillion in assets. They've become the primary vehicle through which most Americans invest for retirement.

Understanding these products isn't optional if you're in the securities industry. It's foundational.

## Learning Objectives

## What is an Investment Company?

<div class="exam-focus">
  <div class="exam-focus__label">EXAM FOCUS - HIGH PRIORITY</div>
  <p><strong>This topic was marked WEAK on your practice exam.</strong> Pay close attention to the three types of investment companies and their distinguishing characteristics.</p>
</div>

An investment company does exactly what the name suggests: it's a company that invests. More specifically, it:

- Issues securities to raise capital from investors
- Uses those proceeds to build a portfolio of securities
- Allows investors to own shares of that diversified pool

Think of it as crowdfunding for Wall Street, except it predates that term by about 90 years.

### The Investment Company Act of 1940

After the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, Congress decided that maybe—just maybe—some regulation of pooled investment vehicles would be prudent. The Investment Company Act of 1940 established the framework we still use today.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The 1929 crash exposed serious problems with pooled investments of the era. Many were highly leveraged, charged excessive fees, and lacked transparency. The Investment Company Act of 1940 addressed these issues by requiring registration, disclosure, and operational standards.</p>
</div>

The Act recognizes three types of investment companies:

```

**Face-Amount Certificate Companies** are largely historical relics—they promised to pay a fixed sum at maturity if you made periodic payments. Think of them as a hybrid between a savings bond and an annuity. You'll rarely encounter them in practice, but they may appear on your exam.

The other two types are where the action is.

## Management Companies

Management companies are <span class="key-term">actively managed</span> portfolios of securities. A fund manager—called an <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span>—makes decisions about what to buy and sell based on the fund's <span class="key-term">investment objective</span>.

This is the key distinction: someone is actively making decisions. Whether those decisions add value after fees is a debate that has launched a thousand academic papers and at least one very successful index fund company in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

### Open-End Management Companies – MUTUAL FUNDS

When most people say "mutual fund," they mean an open-end management company. Here's what defines them:

- **Can only issue common stock** — no bonds or preferred shares
- **The number of shares is "open-ended"** — the fund creates new shares when investors buy and retires shares when they sell
- **Shares are non-negotiable** — you can't sell your shares to another investor on an exchange
- **Shares are redeemed** at the Net Asset Value (NAV) — the fund itself buys back your shares

The "open-ended" nature is crucial. When you invest $10,000 in a mutual fund, the fund creates new shares for you. When you withdraw, those shares disappear. The fund is constantly expanding and contracting.

### Closed-End Management Companies – PUBLICLY TRADED FUNDS

Closed-end funds work differently:

- **Can issue stocks or bonds**
- **One-time stock issuance** — after the IPO, no new shares are created
- **Shares trade on an exchange or OTC** — like regular stocks
- **Not redeemable** — the fund doesn't buy back shares; you sell to another investor

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Share creation</strong></td>
        <td>CONTINUOUS (creates/destroys daily)</td>
        <td>ONE-TIME at IPO only</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Where to trade</strong></td>
        <td>REDEEM with the fund at NAV</td>
        <td>On EXCHANGE like stocks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Price vs NAV</strong></td>
        <td>ALWAYS at NAV</td>
        <td>Can trade at PREMIUM or DISCOUNT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Prospectus</strong></td>
        <td>Required EVERY purchase</td>
        <td>Only at IPO (secondary = no)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Premium and Discount</div>
  <p>Because closed-end fund shares trade on the open market, they can trade at a <strong>premium</strong> or <strong>discount</strong> to their NAV. If a fund holds $100 million in securities but investors are pessimistic about its prospects, it might trade at $95 million (a 5% discount). If investors are enthusiastic, it might trade at $105 million (a 5% premium).</p>
</div>

This creates arbitrage opportunities that don't exist with open-end funds—and exam questions that definitely do.

## Unit Investment Trusts

<div class="exam-focus">
  <div class="exam-focus__label">UIT KEY DISTINCTIONS</div>
  <p>UITs are different from management companies in THREE critical ways the exam tests:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>NO ACTIVE MANAGEMENT</strong> — portfolio is FIXED at creation</li>
    <li><strong>HAS A TERMINATION DATE</strong> — trust winds down</li>
    <li><strong>NO BOARD OF DIRECTORS</strong> — has a TRUSTEE instead</li>
  </ol>
</div>

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) take a different approach: they assemble a fixed portfolio and hold it. No active management. No trading. Just... holding.

- Issue <span class="key-term">shares of beneficial interest</span> representing an undivided interest in the trust
- Have a <span class="key-term">termination date</span> — the trust eventually winds down
- Have <span class="key-term">no board of directors</span> — there's a trustee instead

### Fixed UIT

The classic UIT:

- Selects a fixed portfolio of unmanaged securities
- Traditionally bonds (hence the "fixed" name)
- Once selected, the portfolio doesn't change
- Matures at a fixed date

If you want to know exactly what you own and don't want anyone tinkering with it, a fixed UIT delivers that certainty.

### Non-Fixed UIT

Non-fixed UITs invest in mutual funds, typically within insurance company products:

- <span class="key-term">Variable Annuities</span> are the primary example
- Use investment companies to provide investment options
- Popular for retirement planning

The "non-fixed" refers to the fact that the underlying mutual funds are actively managed, even though the UIT structure itself is passive.

## Test Preparation

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The exam loves to test the differences between open-end and closed-end funds. Remember: open-end = continuous issuance and redemption at NAV; closed-end = one-time issuance, trades on exchange, can trade at premium or discount.</p>
</div>

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Three types of investment companies**: Face-amount certificate companies (rare), management companies, and UITs
2. **Open-end funds**: Create and redeem shares continuously at NAV
3. **Closed-end funds**: Fixed number of shares trading on exchanges
4. **UITs**: Fixed portfolio, no active management, have termination dates

### Practice Questions Preview

- Questions comparing open-end vs. closed-end fund characteristics
- Scenarios asking which type of fund trades at premiums/discounts
- Questions about UIT structure and termination

## Summary

Investment companies pool investor money to create diversified portfolios. The Investment Company Act of 1940 established three categories: face-amount certificate companies (historical), management companies (open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds), and unit investment trusts.

The key distinctions center on how shares are issued, whether they can be redeemed, and whether the portfolio is actively managed.

### Quick Reference

**Key Terms:**
- <span class="key-term">Investment Company</span>: Entity that pools investor capital to invest in securities
- <span class="key-term">NAV (Net Asset Value)</span>: Per-share value of fund assets minus liabilities
- <span class="key-term">Redemption</span>: Fund buying back shares from investors at NAV
- <span class="key-term">Open-End Fund</span>: Mutual fund that continuously issues and redeems shares
- <span class="key-term">Closed-End Fund</span>: Fund with fixed shares trading on exchanges
