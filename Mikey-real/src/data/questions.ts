    question: 'What type of agency relationship exists when a broker represents both the buyer and seller in the same transaction?',
    answer: 'Dual agency',
    explanation: 'Think of it like trying to coach both teams in the Finals - that\'s dual agency. You\'re repping both buyer AND seller, which is tricky because you can\'t fully go to bat for either one. Both sides have to agree to it in writing.',
    memoryHook: '🏀 Imagine being MJ\'s agent AND the Bulls\' GM at the same time. Who you really looking out for? That\'s the problem with dual agency - you can\'t go hard for both sides. Like trying to rep both Kendrick and Drake when they\'re beefing.',

    question: 'Which of the following is required for a valid real estate contract?',
    answer: 'Consideration',
    explanation: 'Consideration just means "something of value" being exchanged. Usually it\'s money, but it could be anything valuable. No consideration = no real contract. You need this plus: people who can legally sign, an offer that gets accepted, a legal purpose, and a proper description of the property.',
    memoryHook: '🎤 Every contract needs consideration - something of value going both ways. Think about when an artist signs with a label: they get money and promotion, the label gets music and rights. Both sides gotta give something. No consideration = no deal.',

    answer: 'Subjectivity',
    explanation: 'Remember OLDCAR - your Starting 5 plus Sixth Man: Obedience, Loyalty, Disclosure, Confidentiality, Accountability, Reasonable care. These are what you owe your client. "Subjectivity" isn\'t one of them - actually you want to be objective, not subjective.',
    memoryHook: '🏀 OLDCAR is your starting lineup: O-bedience, L-oyalty, D-isclosure, C-onfidentiality, A-ccountability, R-easonable care. Like MJ\'s Bulls - each one has a role. "Subjectivity" ain\'t on the team. You gotta stay objective, not let your feelings mess up the game.',

    answer: 'Open listing',
    explanation: 'Open listing is like open gym - anyone can play. The seller can list with multiple agents AND sell it themselves. Whoever actually brings the buyer gets paid. If the seller finds their own buyer? No commission to anyone.',
    memoryHook: '🏀 Open listing = open gym. Anyone can show up and play. The seller can work with multiple agents, and whoever brings the buyer scores the commission. If the seller finds their own buyer, they keep all the money. No guaranteed playing time for any agent.',

    question: 'What is the primary purpose of an earnest money deposit?',
    answer: 'To show good faith intent to purchase',
    explanation: 'Earnest money is like putting down a deposit on playoff tickets - it shows you\'re serious about buying. The money sits in an escrow account and goes toward your purchase price at closing. If you back out for no good reason, you might lose it.',
    memoryHook: '🎫 Earnest money is like putting money down on concert tickets before they drop. You\'re showing you\'re serious - you got skin in the game. Back out for no reason? You might lose that deposit. It proves you\'re not just talking.',

    question: 'Which document transfers ownership of real property?',
    answer: 'Deed',
    explanation: 'The deed is THE document that says "this property now belongs to you." It transfers ownership from the seller (grantor) to the buyer (grantee). There are different types - warranty deeds give you more protection, quitclaim deeds give you less.',
    memoryHook: '🎤 The deed is like owning your masters. It\'s the paper that says "this is YOURS." When you get the deed, you own it for real. Like how artists fight to own their music - the deed is your proof of ownership.',

    answer: 'It terminates the original offer',
    explanation: 'When you make a counteroffer, you\'re basically saying "no" to the original offer and starting fresh with a new one. The original offer is dead. Now the other person can accept your counter, reject it, or come back with their own counter.',
    memoryHook: '🎤 Counteroffers kill the original offer - it\'s dead. Like when someone offers you a weak feature deal and you come back with different terms. That first offer? Gone. Now they gotta respond to YOUR terms. Can\'t go back to the old deal.',

    answer: 'Contracts for the sale of real property',
    explanation: 'The Statute of Frauds says: if you\'re dealing with real estate, get it in writing. Handshake deals don\'t count in court. This includes sales, leases over a year, and easements. No paper = no enforceable deal.',
    memoryHook: '📝 "Statute of Frauds" = get it in writing or it\'s fraud-ish. Real estate deals HAVE to be on paper. Like how artists got burned by handshake deals back in the day. If it ain\'t in writing, it ain\'t real. Protect yourself.',

    memoryHook: '🏀 Joint tenancy = MJ and Pippen ownership. If one passes, the other automatically gets their share. No lawyers, no court, no drama. The "right of survivorship" means the survivor gets everything. It stays in the team.',

    explanation: 'An encumbrance is anything that affects the property or limits what you can do with it. Easements, liens, deed restrictions - these are all encumbrances. They don\'t stop you from owning it, but they come with the property and can affect its value.',
    memoryHook: '⚖️ Encumbrance = something weighing down your property. Like having a feature artist on your track - they got rights too. An easement means someone else has rights to use part of your land. You still own it, but it comes with strings.',

    answer: 'Police power',
    explanation: 'Police power is the government\'s ability to make rules for public health, safety, and welfare. Zoning laws, building codes, health regulations - all police power. It\'s not about cops, it\'s about the government\'s power to regulate how property is used.',
    memoryHook: '🏛️ Police power = the government\'s rule book. Like the NBA has rules about traveling and fouls. Zoning is the government saying "this area is for homes, this area is for businesses." It\'s about keeping order, not about actual police.',

    answer: 'Runs with the land and transfers with ownership',
    explanation: 'An appurtenant easement is attached to the land, not to a person. When you sell the property, the easement goes with it automatically. Like if your neighbor has the right to use your driveway - that right transfers to whoever buys their house.',
    memoryHook: '🚗 Appurtenant easement = stuck to the property like a jersey number. When the property sells, the easement goes with it. Like how SEPTA has permanent rights to run through certain areas - doesn\'t matter who owns the land.',

    question: 'Which government power allows the government to take private property for public use?',
    answer: 'Eminent domain',
    explanation: 'Eminent domain is when the government says "we need your land for a road/school/whatever public project." They CAN take it, but they HAVE to pay you fair market value. It\'s in the Constitution - the 5th Amendment.',
    memoryHook: '🏗️ Eminent domain = "E" for "Everybody needs this land." The government can take your property for public use - new highway, new school, whatever. But they HAVE to pay you fair value. Think of when Philly needed land for the stadiums.',

    answer: 'Loan-to-Value ratio',
    explanation: 'LTV is like your shooting percentage, but for loans. If you\'re borrowing $180K on a $200K house, that\'s 90% LTV ($180K ÷ $200K). The higher your LTV, the more the bank worries you might default, which is why high LTV usually means you need PMI.',
    memoryHook: '🏀 LTV = your shooting percentage for loans. Loan divided by Value. Borrowing $180K on a $200K house? That\'s 90% LTV. Lower is better - like shooting 50% is better than 90% (wait, flip that for loans). More down payment = lower LTV = bank trusts you more.',

    question: 'Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is typically required when:',
    answer: 'The down payment is less than 20%',
    explanation: 'PMI is insurance that protects the LENDER (not you) if you stop paying. If you put down less than 20%, the bank sees more risk, so they make you pay for PMI. Good news: once you build up 20% equity, you can usually get rid of it.',
    memoryHook: '💰 PMI kicks in under 20% down. The bank\'s thinking: "You ain\'t got much skin in the game, so we need insurance." PMI protects THEM, not you. Once you hit 20% equity, you can drop it. It\'s like paying for the bank\'s safety net.',

    answer: 'Disclosure of settlement costs to borrowers',
    explanation: 'RESPA is all about transparency - making sure you know what you\'re paying for when you buy a house. Lenders have to give you estimates upfront and detailed breakdowns at closing. It also bans kickbacks between lenders and agents. No shady stuff.',
    memoryHook: '📋 RESPA = Real talk about costs. RE-S-P-A, like R-E-S-P-E-C-T - they gotta respect you with honest numbers. No hidden fees, no surprises at closing. Lenders have to show you what you\'re paying upfront. Transparency is the law.',

    answer: 'Due-on-sale clause',
    explanation: 'The due-on-sale clause means you can\'t just hand over your mortgage to someone else when you sell. The bank wants to approve any new borrower. If you sell without their OK, they can demand the full balance right then. No passing your loan like a basketball.',
    memoryHook: '🏀 Due-on-sale = can\'t pass your mortgage like a basketball. When you sell, the loan is DUE. The bank approved YOU, not whoever you\'re selling to. They want their money or they want to approve the new person. No alley-oops with mortgages.',

    answer: 'To protect against defects in the title',
    explanation: 'Title insurance protects you if someone comes out of nowhere claiming they own your house, or there\'s a lien nobody knew about. It covers problems that existed BEFORE you bought - stuff that might not have shown up in the title search.',
    memoryHook: '🛡️ Title insurance = protection against ghosts from the past. What if someone shows up saying "my grandma owned this house"? Title insurance has your back. It covers problems from BEFORE you bought - hidden liens, ownership disputes, all that.',

    question: 'What is the difference between the interest rate and the APR?',
    answer: 'APR includes the interest rate plus other loan costs',
    explanation: 'The interest rate is just the interest. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the REAL cost of the loan - it includes interest PLUS points, PMI, fees, and other costs. APR is always higher because it factors in more stuff. Use APR to compare loans.',
    memoryHook: '💵 APR = ALL the costs. Interest rate is just one piece. APR includes interest PLUS points, fees, PMI - everything. It\'s like the difference between a car\'s sticker price and the "out the door" price. APR shows you the real deal.',
