                Running a mutual fund isn't a one-person job. It takes a team of specialized players, each with distinct responsibilities and regulatory obligations. Understanding who does what—and who pays whom—helps explain why fund expenses exist and where your money actually goes.

                The <span class="key-term">custodian bank</span> is like the vault keeper—they hold the actual securities and ensure they're properly safeguarded. The <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span> makes the investment decisions. The <span class="key-term">selling group</span> gets the fund into investors' hands.

                <div class="info-box__title">Important Distinction</div>
                <p>The investment adviser's contract must be approved by shareholders. This gives investors a voice in who manages their money—and how much they're paid to do it.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Mutual Funds</h2>

            <p>Why did mutual funds become the dominant investment vehicle for regular Americans? Three reasons:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Professional Money Management</strong> — Someone else does the research</li>
                <li><strong>Diversification</strong> — Own hundreds of securities with a single purchase</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Variety of Fund Objectives</strong> — Whatever your goal, there's probably a fund for it</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The 75-5-10 Rule: What Makes a "Diversified" Fund</h2>

            <p>The Investment Company Act defines a <span class="key-term">diversified fund</span> using the <strong>75-5-10 Rule</strong>:</p>

            <div class="comparison-table">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Requirement</th>
                            <th>Meaning</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>75%</strong></td>
                            <td>At least 75% of the fund's assets must be invested in securities</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>5%</strong></td>
                            <td>No more than 5% of the fund's assets can be invested in any one issuer</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>10%</strong></td>
                            <td>A maximum of 10% of the voting securities of one issuer is allowed</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The 75-5-10 rule only applies to 75% of the portfolio. The other 25% can be invested however the fund chooses—even entirely in one security.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Non-Diversified Funds</h3>

            <p>
                A fund that doesn't meet the 75-5-10 requirements is classified as <span class="key-term">non-diversified</span>. This isn't necessarily bad—a fund that only invests in U.S. Treasuries would be non-diversified but hardly risky.

                <p>
                    These have become enormously popular in 401(k) plans because they automatically adjust asset allocation as retirement approaches. A "2050 Fund" holds mostly stocks today but will shift toward bonds as 2050 nears. It's professional management on autopilot.

            <h2>Key Points to Remember</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Custodian bank</strong> holds the assets; <strong>investment adviser</strong> makes decisions</li>
                <li><strong>75-5-10 Rule:</strong> 75% in securities, max 5% per issuer, max 10% voting control</li>
                <li><strong>Non-diversified</strong> doesn't mean high-risk—it means concentrated</li>
                <li><strong>Target date funds</strong> automatically adjust allocation over time</li>
            </ul>
