# Fund Management & Structure

## Introduction

Running a mutual fund isn't a one-person job. It takes a team of specialized players, each with distinct responsibilities and regulatory obligations. Understanding who does what—and who pays whom—helps explain why fund expenses exist and where your money actually goes.

This section covers the organizational structure of mutual funds, the rules that govern diversification, and the various fund types available to investors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Identify the key parties involved in fund operations
- Apply the 75-5-10 diversification rule
- Distinguish between diversified and non-diversified funds
- Match fund types to investor objectives

  </table>
</div>

| Party | Role | Compensation |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Custodian Bank** | Safeguards fund assets; may act as Transfer Agent and Paying Agent | Custodial fees |
| **Investment Adviser** | Manages fund within stated objectives; contract approved by shareholders | Management fees (% of AUM) |
| **Fund Sponsor (Underwriter)** | Creates and distributes the fund | Underwriting fees |
| **Selling Group** | Acts as agent selling shares at POP | Selling concession |

The <span class="key-term">custodian bank</span> is like the vault keeper—they hold the actual securities and ensure they're properly safeguarded. The <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span> makes the investment decisions. The <span class="key-term">selling group</span> gets the fund into investors' hands.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Important Distinction</div>
  <p>The investment adviser's contract must be approved by shareholders. This gives investors a voice in who manages their money—and how much they're paid to do it.</p>

## Benefits of Mutual Funds

Why did mutual funds become the dominant investment vehicle for regular Americans? Three reasons:

1. **Professional Money Management** — Someone else does the research
2. **Diversification** — Own hundreds of securities with a single purchase
3. **Wide Variety of Fund Objectives** — Whatever your goal, there's probably a fund for it

## The 75-5-10 Rule: What Makes a "Diversified" Fund

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS - 75-5-10 RULE</div>
  <p>This rule defines what makes a fund "diversified" under the Investment Company Act. <strong>HEAVILY TESTED.</strong></p>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Number</th>
        <th>What It Means</th>
        <th>Memory Trick</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>75%</strong></td>
        <td>At least 75% of assets must be in securities</td>
        <td>"75% must be invested"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>5%</strong></td>
        <td>Max 5% of fund assets in ANY ONE issuer</td>
        <td>"5% max per company"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>10%</strong></td>
        <td>Max 10% of ONE issuer's VOTING securities</td>
        <td>"10% voting control limit"</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The Investment Company Act defines a <span class="key-term">diversified fund</span> using the **75-5-10 Rule**:

| Requirement | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **75%** | At least 75% of the fund's assets must be invested in securities |
| **5%** | No more than 5% of the fund's assets can be invested in any one issuer |
| **10%** | A maximum of 10% of the voting securities of one issuer is allowed |

<div class="exam-focus">
  <div class="exam-focus__label">EXAM TRAP ALERT</div>
  <p><strong>The 75-5-10 rule only applies to 75% of the portfolio!</strong> The other 25% can be invested however the fund chooses—even entirely in ONE security. This is a common trick question.</p>
</div>

### Non-Diversified Funds

A fund that doesn't meet the 75-5-10 requirements is classified as <span class="key-term">non-diversified</span>. This isn't necessarily bad—a fund that only invests in U.S. Treasuries would be non-diversified but hardly risky.

**Example:** A sector fund focusing exclusively on technology stocks might be non-diversified because it concentrates holdings in a few large tech companies.

## Types of Funds

The fund industry has created options for virtually every investment philosophy:

| Fund Type | Description | Suitable For |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Growth Funds** | Invests in equities of rapidly growing companies for capital gains | Investors seeking appreciation, willing to accept volatility |
| **Growth and Income Funds** | Provides both dividend income and growth potential | Investors wanting balance of income and growth |
| **Income Funds** | Invests in fixed income securities like preferred stocks and bonds | Conservative investors seeking regular income |
| **Balanced Funds** | Maintains a balance of stocks and bonds | Moderate-risk investors seeking diversification |
| **Index Funds** | Tracks the performance of an index like the S&P 500 | Cost-conscious investors seeking market returns |
| **Specialized (Sector) Funds** | Invests in a particular industry or geographic area | Investors with specific sector views |
| **Target Date Funds** | Automatically adjusts allocation as target date approaches | Retirement savers wanting hands-off management |

### Target Date Funds: A Closer Look

<span class="key-term">Target Date Funds</span> deserve special mention. They've become enormously popular in 401(k) plans because they automatically adjust asset allocation as retirement approaches.

A "2050 Fund" holds mostly stocks today but will shift toward bonds as 2050 nears. It's professional management on autopilot.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">How Target Date Funds Work</div>
  <p>Early years: 90% stocks, 10% bonds (aggressive growth)<br>
  Middle years: 60% stocks, 40% bonds (moderate)<br>
  Near target: 30% stocks, 70% bonds (conservative)<br>
  The "glide path" varies by fund family.</p>

## Test Preparation

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Know the 75-5-10 rule cold. The exam will test whether you can apply it to specific scenarios. Remember: it only applies to 75% of assets—the fund has flexibility with the remaining 25%.</p>
</div>

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Custodian bank** holds the assets; **investment adviser** makes decisions
2. **75-5-10 Rule**: 75% in securities, max 5% per issuer, max 10% voting control
3. **Non-diversified** doesn't mean high-risk—it means concentrated
4. **Target date funds** automatically adjust allocation over time

### Common Misconceptions

1. **Misconception**: All mutual funds are diversified
   - **Reality**: Non-diversified funds exist and are legal—they just don't meet the 75-5-10 standard

2. **Misconception**: Index funds are actively managed
   - **Reality**: Index funds are passively managed—they track an index, not beat it

---

## Summary

Mutual funds operate through a structure of specialized parties: custodian banks safeguard assets, investment advisers make decisions, and selling groups distribute shares. Diversified funds must meet the 75-5-10 rule, while non-diversified funds have more concentrated portfolios.

Fund types range from aggressive growth funds to conservative income funds, with target date funds offering automatic rebalancing for retirement savers.
