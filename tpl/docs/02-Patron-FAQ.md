## COPYING

**Q: How do I make a simple black and white copy?**
A: Place your document (feeder = face up, glass = face down). Press **Copy**, tap **Black**, enter the number of copies, and press **Start**.

**Q: How do I make a color copy?**
A: Place your document. Press **Copy**, tap **Full Color**, enter the number of copies, and press **Start**. Note: Color copies may cost more than black and white.

**Q: How do I copy double-sided (both sides of the paper)?**
A: Press **Copy**, then tap **1-Sided/2-Sided**. Choose **1→2** to turn single-sided pages into double-sided, or **2→2** if your original is already double-sided. Press **Start**.

**Q: Which way do I put my paper in?**
A: For the **top feeder (ADF)**: Place pages face **up** with the top edge going in first. For the **glass**: Lift the lid and place your page face **down**, aligned to the arrow in the corner.

**Q: I put my document in the wrong way. What do I get?**
A: You may get blank pages or upside-down copies. Try this first: Remove your document, check the orientation, and try again.

**Q: How do I copy onto legal-size paper?**
A: Press **Copy**, then tap **Paper**. Select the drawer that has legal paper loaded. If you are unsure which drawer has legal paper, ask the Reference Desk Librarian.

**Q: How do I make my copy bigger or smaller?**
A: Press **Copy**, then tap **Zoom** or **Reproduction Ratio**. Choose a preset percentage or type in your own. 100% = same size, 50% = half size, 200% = double size.

**Q: How do I cancel a copy job?**
A: Press **Stop** on the screen or the physical button. Confirm when asked. Your job will be canceled and any scanned pages will be cleared.

**Q: Can I copy a book or magazine?**
A: Yes. Open the lid, place the book face down on the glass with the spine toward the center, and gently press down. Press **Copy**, choose your settings, and press **Start**. You may need to copy one page at a time.

**Q: Why did my copy come out in black and white when I wanted color?**
A: The machine may be set to **Black** by default to save costs. Try this first: Before pressing **Start**, tap **Full Color** to switch to color mode. Check the screen to confirm your selection.

## SCANNING

**Q: How do I scan a document to my USB drive?**
A: Plug in your USB drive and wait for the screen to say **"Found USB Device"**. Press **Scan**, tap **USB**, place your document, and press **Scan**. When finished, press **Job Finish**. Wait for the message **"USB Device can be removed"** before unplugging.

**Q: Why won't the machine recognize my USB drive?**
A: Try this first: Remove the drive, wait 5 seconds, and plug it back in firmly. If it still does not work, your drive may be formatted incorrectly. The machine only reads FAT32 or exFAT drives. NTFS drives will not work. Ask the Reference Desk Librarian if you need help.

**Q: What is the difference between PDF and JPEG?**
A: **PDF** is best for documents with text — it keeps multiple pages in one file. **JPEG** is best for photos or single images. For most documents, choose PDF.

**Q: How do I scan multiple pages into one file?**
A: After your first page scans, place the next page and press **Scan** again. Repeat for all pages. When done, press **Job Finish**. Make sure **Multi** is selected (not **Single**) to combine all pages into one file.

**Q: How do I scan to my email?**
A: Press **Scan**, then tap **E-mail**. Enter your email address or select it from the address book. Choose **PDF** as the format. Place your document and press **Scan**. When done, press **Job Finish**. Check your inbox (and spam folder) in a few minutes. Note: This feature may not be available at all locations.

**Q: My scan never arrived in my email. What happened?**
A: Try this first: Check your spam or junk folder. If it is not there, the file may have been too large. For long documents (more than 10 pages), use **Scan to USB** instead. If the problem continues, ask the Reference Desk Librarian.

**Q: When do I press Job Finish?**
A: Press **Job Finish** after you have scanned ALL your pages. This tells the machine you are done and saves or sends your file. If you forget this step, your scan may not be saved.

**Q: I pressed Scan but nothing happened. What's wrong?**
A: Try this first: Make sure your document is placed correctly (feeder = face up, glass = face down). Check that you selected a destination (USB or E-mail). Then press **Scan** again.

**Q: Can I scan in color?**
A: Yes. Before pressing **Scan**, look for a color setting and choose **Full Color**. Note that color scans create larger files and may take longer to email.

**Q: What resolution should I use?**
A: For most documents, **200 dpi** is fine. Use **300 dpi** if you plan to print the scan later or need higher quality. Higher resolution = larger file size.

**Q: I removed my USB drive and my file is corrupted. Why?**
A: You removed the drive too soon. Always wait until the screen displays **"USB Device can be removed"** before unplugging. The machine needs time to finish writing the file.

## PRINTING

**Q: How do I print from a library computer?**
A: Open your document and select **Print**. Choose **Cloud Print** as your printer and click **Print**. Note the **User ID and Password** taped to the bottom of the monitor. Then go to the printer, touch the orange **Elevate Sky Print** icon, enter the User ID and Password, touch the green **Go** button, select your document, and touch **Print**.

**Q: Where do I find the User ID and Password?**
A: The User ID and Password are taped to the bottom of the computer monitor (example: "0001"). You will need this to release your print job at the printer.

**Q: I don't see "Cloud Print" as a printer option. What do I do?**
A: Ask the Reference Desk Librarian for assistance. They can help you select the correct printer.

**Q: I sent a print job but I don't see it on the printer. Where is it?**
A: At the printer, touch the **Elevate Sky Print** icon and log in. Look for the icon with a **number in a white circle** — that number shows how many jobs are waiting. If there is no number, your job did not send. Try this first: Go back to the computer, make sure you selected **Cloud Print**, and print again.

**Q: How do I print double-sided?**
A: You can choose **2-Sided** when you confirm your print settings at the printer, or set it before printing on the computer. Look for **2-Sided Printing** or **Duplex** in your print settings.

**Q: My pages printed sideways. How do I fix this?**
A: Try this first: Before printing, check your document orientation. In the print settings on the computer, select **Portrait** (tall) or **Landscape** (wide) to match your document.

**Q: My document printed on the wrong size paper. What happened?**
A: The paper size in your document did not match the printer settings. Try this first: Before printing, go to print settings and select the correct paper size (Letter, Legal, etc.).

**Q: How do I cancel a print job?**
A: At the printer, touch the **Elevate Sky Print** icon, log in, find your job in the list, and look for a **Delete** or **Cancel** option. On the computer, you can cancel from the print queue before the job is sent.

**Q: How much does printing cost?**
A: Black & White: $0.10 (Letter), $0.15 (Legal), $0.20 (Ledger) + tax. Color: $0.30 (Letter), $0.45 (Legal), $0.60 (Ledger) + tax. Pay at the Front Desk immediately after printing. Credit for totals $1.00 or more; cash for any total.
