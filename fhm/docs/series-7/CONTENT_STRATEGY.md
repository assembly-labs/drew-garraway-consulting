# Series 7 Content Strategy

**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Purpose:** Define how Series 7 content will be created, organized, and prioritized using FHM brand voice and SIE structural patterns.

---

## Core Philosophy

### From SIE Content Strategy
> "Regulations are monuments to past failures."

Every Series 7 rule exists because something went wrong. When students understand *why*, they remember. This approach is even more critical for Series 7, where the material is denser and more calculation-heavy.

### The 90/10 Rule Applied
- **90%** clear, practical exam content
- **10%** memorable stories and observations

Series 7 candidates are future registered representatives. The content should respect their intelligence while making complex topics approachable.

| Section 3: Provides Info | 73% | 70-75% | **HIGHEST** |
| Section 4: Processes Transactions | 7% | 5-8% | Lower |

### Section 3 Internal Priorities

Within Section 3 (73% of exam), prioritize by typical exam weight:

| Topic | Est. Weight | Content Depth | Priority |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Options | 25-30% | **MAXIMUM** | Critical |
| Municipal Bonds | 15-20% | Heavy | Critical |

## Lesson Structure & Length

### Standard Lesson Format

Based on SIE patterns, each lesson follows this structure:

1. **Opening Hook** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Story, historical context, or "why this matters"
   - Never start with a definition

2. **Learning Objectives** (4-6 bullet points)
   - Specific, measurable outcomes
   - Test-relevant skills

3. **Core Content** (1,500-2,500 words)
   - 3-5 major sections
   - Clear hierarchy (H2 → H3 → H4)
   - Examples throughout
   - Visual elements (tables, boxes)

4. **Test Preparation** (200-300 words)
   - Key exam traps
   - Memory aids
   - Common mistakes

5. **Summary** (150-250 words)
   - Quick reference
   - Key terms list
   - Formulas (if applicable)

6. **Next Steps**
   - Link to related content
   - Practice recommendation

### Length Guidelines by Topic Complexity

| Topic Type | Target Length | Min | Max |
|------------|---------------|-----|-----|
| Foundational concept | 1,500-2,000 | 1,200 | 2,500 |

| Calculation-heavy | 2,500-3,000 | 2,000 | 3,500 |
| Overview/intro | 1,000-1,500 | 800 | 1,800 |

### Lessons per Chapter

| Chapter Size | Lessons | When to Use |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Small | 1-2 | Simple topics (ADRs, hedge funds) |
| Medium | 3-4 | Standard topics (most chapters) |

   ```

2. **Formula Cards** (20%)
   ```
   Front: "How do you calculate long margin buying power?"

   ```

3. **Comparison Cards** (20%)
   ```
   Front: "Bull call spread vs. bear call spread: Which is debit? Which is credit?"
   Back: "Bull call spread = DEBIT (buy lower strike). Bear call spread = CREDIT (sell lower strike). Remember: Bulls charge forward (buy first)."
   ```

Apply FHM brand voice:

1. **Write opening hook** - Story or "why it matters"
2. **Add historical context** - Why does this rule exist?
3. **Include real examples** - Concrete numbers and scenarios
4. **Insert one humor moment** - Per section, no more
5. **Explain the "why"** - Not just the what

### Phase 3: Structure

Apply lesson template:
- Add frontmatter metadata
- Format with HTML components
- Create cross-references
- Add practice question references

### Phase 4: Review

Quality checklist:
- [ ] Opens with hook, not definition
- [ ] Has historical/contextual story

## Content Dependencies

Some topics build on others:

```
Foundation Layer:
├── Securities basics (stock, bond definitions)
├── Account types
└── Order types

Second Layer:
├── Options basics ← needs securities foundation
├── Bond pricing ← needs bond basics
└── Margin basics ← needs account types

Third Layer:
├── Options strategies ← needs options basics
├── Spread calculations ← needs options strategies
├── SMA/Buying power ← needs margin basics
└── Muni trading ← needs muni fundamentals

Fourth Layer:
├── Advanced options ← needs strategies
├── Combined accounts ← needs long + short margin
└── MSRB rules ← needs muni trading
```

**Implication:** Content should be created in this order to allow cross-referencing.

## Implementation Status (Updated February 2026)

The original section-based planning model above guided content priorities. The actual implementation uses a **chapter-based pipeline** (Chapters 1-19, matching Kaplan textbook structure).

### What's Been Built

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| 18 of 19 chapter HTML pages | Published and live |
| Comprehensive formula sheet | Options (T-chart, all strategies), Bond Yield Seesaw, YTM, critical numbers |
| 280 flashcards | Generated across all published chapters |
| Full navigation chain | All 18 chapters linked sequentially |
| Hub page | All chapters accessible |

### Content Pipeline

Each chapter follows: **INTAKE** (screenshots/notes) → **EXTRACT** (raw-notes.md) → **TRANSFORM** (chapter markdown in FHM voice) → **PUBLISH** (HTML page with glossary, summary, navigation)

### Remaining

- Chapter 13: awaiting source materials
- Practice exams 2-5
- Flashcard expansion (280 of ~600 target)
