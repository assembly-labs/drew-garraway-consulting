            <p>
                In 1996, Congress created Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the college savings industry was born. Named after the tax code section that authorized them, 529 plans have grown from a novel idea to holding over $400 billion in assets. Every state now offers at least one plan, and competition has driven down fees dramatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                But 529s aren't the only municipal fund securities you'll encounter on the exam. ABLE accounts help families save for disability-related expenses, while local government investment pools let municipalities park their cash. What ties them together? They're all issued by state or local governments, exempt from the Investment Company Act of 1940, and regulated by the MSRB instead of the SEC.

            <h2>Introduction to Municipal Fund Securities</h2>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">municipal fund security</span> is an investment product issued by a state or municipality. Because it's issued by a state or local government, it is exempt from the rules of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Instead, their sale is regulated by the <span class="key-term">Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Income from municipal fund securities may be exempt from federal taxes and often state and local taxes as well.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">THREE TYPES OF MUNICIPAL FUND SECURITIES</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>529 plans:</strong> Higher education savings plans</li>
                    <li><strong>LGIPs:</strong> Local government investment pools</li>
                    <li><strong>ABLE accounts:</strong> Achieving a Better Life Experience accounts for disabled individuals</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2: 529 PLANS -->
        <section id="529-plans">
            <h2>529 College Savings Plans</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">529 college savings plans</span> are designed to encourage saving for future college costs. Like a 401(k), money is deposited into separate accounts that invest in portfolios similar to mutual funds. Investors cannot select individual stocks and bonds but are limited to portfolios offered by a state's plan. Investment choices can be changed twice a year.
            </p>

            <p>
                Earnings grow tax-deferred. If used for <span class="key-term">qualified educational expenses</span>, withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes. Some states offer tax deductions for contributions, but the federal government does not.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">QUALIFIED EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tuition and school fees</li>
                    <li>Books, supplies, and equipment (including computers)</li>
                    <li>Room and board (for students attending at least half-time)</li>
                    <li>Special needs services</li>
                    <li>K-12 tuition (up to $10,000 annually)</li>
                    <li>Student loan payments (up to $10,000 lifetime total)</li>
                    <li>Apprenticeship program expenses</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>529 Account Characteristics</h3>
            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">529 ACCOUNT FEATURES</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any adult can open an account and name anyone (including themselves) as beneficiary</li>
                    <li>No age limits on beneficiaries; contributor and beneficiary don't need to be related</li>
                    <li><strong>No income limits</strong> for contributions</li>
                    <li><strong>High contribution limits</strong> (vary by state)</li>
                    <li>The <strong>owner controls the account</strong>, not the beneficiary</li>
                    <li>Owner can <strong>change beneficiaries</strong></li>
                    <li>Contributions are considered <strong>gifts</strong> under federal tax law</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Superfunding Rule</h3>
            <p>
                Contributions to 529 plans are subject to federal gift tax limits. However, large gifts can be spread over five years for tax purposes. Making five years' worth of contributions at once is called <span class="key-term">superfunding</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Example: Superfunding</div>
                <p>Chris wants to contribute to a 529 account. The annual gift tax exclusion is $20,000. Using the superfunding rule, Chris makes a $100,000 contribution ($20,000 × 5).</p>
                <p>For tax purposes, this is treated as $20,000 per year over five years. Each year's gift falls within the annual exclusion, so Chris owes no gift tax on the $100,000.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Nonqualified Withdrawals</h3>
            <p>If money is withdrawn for noneducational purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earnings</strong> are taxed as ordinary income</li>
                <li>Earnings face an additional <strong>10% penalty</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Contributions</strong> (principal) are not taxed or penalized</li>
                <li>Withdrawals are proportionally split between earnings and principal</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The penalty does not apply if the withdrawal is due to the beneficiary's death, disability, or receipt of a scholarship.</p>

            <h3>Plan-to-Plan Rollovers</h3>
            <p>
                Funds can be transferred from one state's 529 plan to another without tax consequences if deposited in the new account within <strong>60 days</strong>. Rollovers can only occur <strong>once per 12 months</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary &amp; Key Points</h2>

            <p>
                Municipal fund securities offer tax-advantaged ways to save for education and disability expenses, with state sponsorship and MSRB oversight rather than SEC registration. The key distinctions are which products qualify as securities (529 savings plans, ABLE accounts, LGIPs) versus which don't (prepaid tuition plans), and the specific rules governing each account type.
            </p>

            <div class="key-terms">
                <h3>529 Plans</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>529 Prepaid Tuition Plans:</strong> NOT municipal fund securities; lock in tuition prices; not securities</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Key Terms</h3>
