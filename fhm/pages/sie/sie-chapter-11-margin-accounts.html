                    In October 1929, you could buy $10,000 worth of stock with just $1,000 cash. Brokers happily lent
                    the other 90%. When the market crashed, those loans came due. Investors who couldn't meet their
                    margin calls were forced to sell—at any price—which pushed stocks lower, triggering more margin
                    calls, forcing more sales. The cascade turned a market correction into the Great Depression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why the Federal Reserve now sets the rules for borrowing to buy securities. The current
                    answer to "how much can you borrow?" has been the same since 1974: 50%.

            <section id="intro-margin">
                <h2>Introduction to Margin Accounts</h2>

                <p>
                    Customers can open different types of accounts at a broker-dealer. In a
                    <span class="key-term">cash account</span>, a customer must deposit 100% of the purchase price of a
                    security. A <span class="key-term">margin account</span> allows a customer to borrow either money or
                    securities from a broker-dealer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rules for both cash and margin accounts are governed by the Federal Reserve under
                    <span class="key-term">Regulation T (Reg T)</span>. There are also additional Financial Industry
                    Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requirements for the opening and maintenance of margin accounts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A customer opens a margin account in order to borrow cash or securities from a broker-dealer. By
                    borrowing, the investor is using <span class="key-term">leverage</span>. Leverage can provide
                    greater returns but can also result in greater losses. Risks and returns are lower in a cash
                    account, where the customer does not borrow money.
                </p>

            <section id="reg-t-buying">
                <h2>Regulation T: Buying on Margin</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Regulation T (Reg T)</span> is a Federal Reserve Board regulation that covers
                    lending from broker-dealers to customers. It sets
                    <span class="key-term">initial margin requirements</span> (the percentage of the security's purchase
                    price that the customer must pay for with cash) for marginable securities.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        Before the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, margin requirements were set by individual
                        exchanges—and they were shockingly low. In the 1920s, investors routinely bought stocks with 10%
                        down. When the crash came, those undercapitalized positions collapsed like dominoes. Congress
                        gave the Federal Reserve authority over margin requirements specifically to prevent another
                        leverage-fueled catastrophe. The Fed experimented with different rates over the decades—it was
                        100% briefly in 1946—before settling on 50% in 1974, where it's remained ever since.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Under Reg T, a broker-dealer may lend a customer up to 50% of the purchase price of a
                    <span class="key-term">marginable security</span>.
                </p>

                    <div class="info-box__title">Example: Buying on Margin</div>
                    <p>
                        A customer buys 200 shares of ABC (a New York Stock Exchange-listed stock) at $50 per share.
                        Under Reg T, the <span class="key-term">initial margin requirement</span> is 50% of $10,000 =
                        $5,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To purchase the stock in a margin account, the customer would be required to provide $5,000 and
                        the broker-dealer would lend the customer the additional $5,000.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Exempt Securities</h3>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Exempt securities</span> are not covered under Reg T. The major exempt
                    securities are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>U.S. government securities</li>
                    <li>Agency issues</li>
                    <li>Municipal issues</li>
                    <li>Commercial paper</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The Federal Reserve has no power to set initial margins for these securities. However, these
                    securities are marginable subject to
                    <span class="key-term">minimum maintenance requirements</span> set by FINRA.
                </p>

                <h3>Marginable vs. Non-Marginable Securities</h3>

                <p>
                    Not all securities can be purchased on margin. Nasdaq and all exchange-listed securities are
                    marginable, as are U.S. government and municipal bonds. Over-the-counter (OTC) securities are
                    allowed only if they are listed on the Federal Reserve
                    <span class="key-term">marginable securities list</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Newly issued securities cannot be purchased on margin until they have been publicly traded at least
                    30 days. Because mutual fund shares are always considered new shares, they cannot be purchased on
                    margin. But once mutual fund shares have been held for 30 days, they can be used as collateral for a
                    margin loan.
                </p>

                <h2>Regulation T: Selling Short on Margin</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Short selling</span> is when an investor borrows securities from a
                    broker-dealer, and then sells them. This can only be done in a margin account.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        Short selling has been controversial since the Dutch East India Company in the 1600s. During
                        every market panic, someone blames the short sellers. After the 1929 crash, Congress considered
                        banning the practice entirely. Instead, they opted for regulation. The logic for requiring
                        margin on short sales is straightforward: when you short a stock, your potential loss is
                        theoretically unlimited (the stock could rise forever), so the broker needs collateral to
                        protect against that risk.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    A customer will use a short-selling strategy when they are bearish and believe that the price of the
                    borrowed securities will fall. Their strategy is to sell the securities at the current high price,
                    then buy the securities back at a cheaper price in the future. After they buy the shares at the
                    hopefully lower price, they return them to the broker-dealer (<span class="key-term">covering</span>
                    their short position).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Reg T initial margin requirement is the same for buyers and short-sellers—<strong>50%</strong>.

                        A customer shorts 1,000 shares of XYZ stock. XYZ is currently trading at $10 per share. Reg T
                        requires that the customer deposit 50% of the value of the trade, or $5,000.

            <!-- SECTION 4: REG T FOR CASH ACCOUNTS -->
            <section id="reg-t-cash">
                <h2>Regulation T for Cash Accounts</h2>

                <p>
                    Regulation T (Reg T) also applies to cash accounts. In a cash account, Reg T requires that the
                    broker-dealer collect payment from the customer <span class="key-term">promptly</span>, which means
                    no later than two business days after the settlement date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a stock trade, regular way settlement is one business day. So, Reg T requires payment by the
                    customer within three business days after the trade (T+3), which is two business days after
                    settlement (<span class="key-term">S+2</span>: Settlement + 2 business days).
                </p>

                <h3>Reg T Extension</h3>

                <p>
                    If payment is not collected by S+2, under exceptional circumstances, the firm may ask FINRA for a
                    <span class="key-term">Reg T extension</span>. If granted, this gives the customer another two
                    business days (or longer if a special request is made) to pay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the customer does not pay on either "S+2" or the extension date, if one is granted, the firm is
                    obligated to <span class="key-term">sell out</span> that position and
                    <span class="key-term">freeze the account</span> for 90 days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When an account is <span class="key-term">frozen</span>, the customer can still trade in the
                    account. However, they can no longer borrow and must have 100% of the required cash to pay for the
                    transaction. After 90 days, given that the customer complies, the freeze is removed.
                </p>

                <h3>Free-Riding</h3>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Free-riding</span> is the prohibited practice of buying securities without
                    intending to pay for them, and then selling them on or before the settlement date to generate the
                    cash needed to pay for the original purchase.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Example: Free-Riding Violation</div>
                    <p>
                        XYZ will be announcing quarterly earnings in two days. A customer believes the news will be
                        positive and decides to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at $50 per share. The customer does not have the
                        $50,000 to pay for the stock but plans to sell the stock when the price rises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The customer is trying to take a "free ride" by using the broker-dealer to buy the stock for
                        them. Relying on money from the sale of stock to pay for the purchase of the same stock is a
                        violation. The customer's account will be frozen for 90 days.

                    A <span class="key-term">restricted margin account</span> is where the equity in the customer's

                        A customer buys $80,000 worth of stock in a margin account and deposits the required $40,000
                        initial margin requirement and borrows $40,000 from the broker-dealer. The next day, the stock's
                        value declines to $60,000. How much equity does the customer now have?
                    </p>

                    <p>$60,000 − $40,000 = <strong>$20,000 of equity</strong></p>
                    <p>Equity percentage: $20,000 ÷ $60,000 = <strong>33.33%</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Since the equity percentage has fallen below 50%, the account is now
                    <span class="key-term">restricted</span>. But this restriction has little impact on the customer.
                    They are not required to deposit any more money, the account is not frozen, and they can still buy
                    more stock by depositing only 50% of the purchase price.

                    requirements than the 25% set by FINRA.

                <h3>Special Memorandum Account (SMA)</h3>

                <p>
                    When a security that has been bought on margin increases in value, the equity in the account also
                    increases. When the equity in a margin account rises over 50% of the market value, the amount over
                    50% is referred to as <span class="key-term">excess equity</span>. Excess equity is put into a
                    <span class="key-term">special memorandum account (SMA)</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Excess equity creates buying power of <strong>2 × SMA</strong> (since the initial margin requirement
                    is 50%). This means the customer could use their $5,000 of excess equity to buy $10,000 of stock
                    (meeting the 50% margin requirement). In addition, the SMA amount could be withdrawn from the
                    account in cash. But note that this withdrawal would be considered a loan and added to the amount
                    that the customer owes the broker-dealer.

                <p>
                    To open a "cash" account, only the new account form is required. In a cash account, the customer
                    agrees that they will pay in full for all purchases. To open a margin account, additional
                    documentation is required.

                <h3>The Margin Agreement</h3>

                <p>
                    Prior to opening a margin account, the customer must sign a
                    <span class="key-term">margin agreement</span>. The margin agreement sets the terms and conditions
                    between the customer and broker-dealer.
                </p>

                <p>The agreement has three parts:</p>

                    Alongside the margin agreement, noninstitutional customers opening a margin account must be given a
                    <span class="key-term">credit disclosure statement</span> as well as a
                    <span class="key-term">margin risk disclosure statement</span> explaining the risks of margin

                        Unlike opening a standard cash account (where a signature is NOT required), the margin agreement
                        must be signed by the customer at or prior to settlement of the first trade in the account.

                <h2>Summary &amp; Key Points</h2>

                <p>
                    Margin accounts allow customers to leverage their investments by borrowing from broker-dealers.
                    While this can amplify returns, it also amplifies losses—and creates obligations that can force
                    sales at the worst possible times.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The regulatory framework—Reg T for initial requirements, FINRA rules for maintenance—exists because
                    of hard lessons learned in 1929 and since. Every percentage requirement you memorize for the exam
                    represents a guardrail against the kind of cascading failures that can turn individual losses into
                    systemic crises.
