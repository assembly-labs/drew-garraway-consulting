                In 2009, a man named Allen Stanford was arrested at his girlfriend's home in Virginia. He'd been running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme through certificates of deposit issued by an offshore bank in Antigua—a bank he happened to own. Stanford had been knighted by Antigua, sponsored international cricket tournaments, and cultivated an image of tropical respectability. Sophisticated investors handed him billions.
            </p>
            <p>
                How did no one catch this earlier? Among other failures, the answer involves inadequate customer identification, insufficient due diligence, and a system that didn't ask enough questions about where the money was really going.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every rule in this chapter exists because someone, somewhere, got burned. The paperwork you'll encounter when opening customer accounts isn't bureaucratic busywork—it's the financial industry's scar tissue from decades of fraud, money laundering, and exploitation.

        <!-- SECTION 1: NEW ACCOUNT FORM -->
        <section id="new-account-form">
            <h2>The New Account Form</h2>

            <p>
                Opening a brokerage account requires collecting specific information. The exam tests your knowledge of what's required versus what's merely helpful.
            </p>

            <h3>Required Information</h3>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS - REQUIRED NEW ACCOUNT INFO</div>
                <p>The following must be obtained when opening a customer account:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Name and residence</strong> (a P.O. Box alone is insufficient)</li>
                    <li><strong>Date of birth</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Social Security Number or Tax ID</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Citizenship or resident alien status</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Employment status and employer information</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Whether associated with another FINRA member firm</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Suitability Information</h3>

            <p>Beyond basic identification, firms must gather information to make suitable recommendations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Financial situation</span> — income, net worth, liquid net worth</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Investment objectives</span> — growth, income, capital preservation, speculation</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Investment experience</span> — knowledge level with different products</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Risk tolerance</span> — how much volatility can they stomach?</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Time horizon</span> — when will they need the money?</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Liquidity needs</span> — how quickly might they need access to funds?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">What If the Customer Won't Provide Information?</div>
                <p>Customers can refuse to provide suitability information. If they do, the firm can still open the account, but the representative cannot make recommendations. Without knowing the customer's situation, there's no basis for determining what's suitable.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What's NOT Required</h3>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The exam loves to ask what's NOT required on new account forms. Remember: <strong>A customer signature is NOT required</strong> to open an account. Neither is the customer's investment knowledge level (though it's useful for suitability). Watch for questions that try to trick you into thinking a signature is mandatory.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Principal Approval</h3>

            <p>A principal must approve each new account. The timing depends on the type of trade:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Solicited orders</span> (recommended by the rep): Principal approval required <strong>before</strong> the first transaction</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Unsolicited orders</span> (initiated by the customer): Principal approval must occur <strong>promptly after</strong> the transaction</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2: CIP -->
        <section id="cip">
            <h2>Customer Identification Program (CIP)</h2>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">USA PATRIOT Act</span> was passed in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Among its many provisions, it requires financial institutions to implement a <span class="key-term">Customer Identification Program (CIP)</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>Before the USA PATRIOT Act, opening a brokerage account was surprisingly casual. The 9/11 Commission found that some of the hijackers had opened accounts at major financial institutions with minimal verification. The CIP requirements exist to make the financial system a less hospitable place for terrorists and money launderers.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>CIP Requirements</h3>

            <p>Firms must:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Obtain identifying information</strong> — name, date of birth, address, identification number</li>
                <li><strong>Verify identity</strong> — using documentary methods (government-issued ID) or non-documentary methods (checking databases, references)</li>
                <li><strong>Compare against government lists</strong> — check if the customer appears on any terrorist watch lists</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain records</strong> — keep identification records for <strong>5 years after the account is closed</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">EXAM TRAP - RECORD RETENTION</div>
                <p>CIP records must be kept for <strong>5 years after the account is closed</strong>—not 5 years from account opening. If an account is open for 20 years, you're keeping those records for 25 years total.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 3: KYC -->
        <section id="kyc">
            <h2>Know Your Customer (KYC)</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Know Your Customer (KYC)</span> goes beyond basic identification. It requires firms to use reasonable diligence to understand the customer's investment profile and to keep that information current.
            </p>

            <p>KYC means understanding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The customer's financial situation</li>
                <li>Their investment experience and objectives</li>
                <li>Whether recommendations are suitable</li>
                <li>Any red flags that might indicate problematic activity</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>KYC evolved from the same regulatory wave that produced the Bank Secrecy Act and was dramatically strengthened after 9/11. But the core concept emerged from decades of scandals where brokers made recommendations to customers they knew nothing about—or worse, deliberately ignored red flags about suspicious customers to keep earning commissions. When firms don't know their customers, bad actors can use the financial system for laundering, fraud, or market manipulation.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 4: AML -->
        <section id="aml">
            <h2>Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</h2>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">Bank Secrecy Act</span> established the framework for detecting and preventing money laundering in the United States. Financial institutions must implement AML programs that include:
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>The Bank Secrecy Act was passed in 1970 when Congress realized organized crime families were using banks to launder cash from drug trafficking and illegal gambling. By requiring cash transaction reports, Congress hoped to create a "paper trail" that law enforcement could follow. Within two years, the BSA was invoked in the Watergate investigation—the scandal that gave "money laundering" its permanent place in our vocabulary. The $10,000 CTR threshold has remained unchanged since 1970 (worth about $80,000 in today's dollars), which is why regulators focus so heavily on "structuring"—criminals breaking transactions into smaller amounts to avoid reporting.</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>Written AML procedures</li>
                <li>Designation of an AML compliance officer</li>
                <li>Employee training</li>
                <li>Independent testing of the program</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</h3>

            <p>A <span class="key-term">Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)</span> must be filed when a firm detects potentially suspicious activity.</p>

        <section id="reg-sp">
            <h2>Regulation S-P: Privacy Rules</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Regulation S-P</span> governs how financial institutions handle customer privacy. The "S-P" stands for "Safeguarding Personal" information.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>Regulation S-P exists because of a trade-off Congress made in 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act tore down the Depression-era walls between banks, securities firms, and insurance companies—allowing them to merge and cross-sell products. Great for consumers, but terrifying for privacy advocates: now your bank could share your financial information with affiliated brokerage and insurance arms. Consumer groups demanded protection. The result was Title V of the Act, which the SEC implemented as Regulation S-P in 2000. Every privacy notice you receive exists because Congress let the financial industry consolidate—and privacy was the price of admission.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Privacy Notice Requirements</h3>

            <p>Firms must provide customers with:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><span class="key-term">Initial Privacy Notice</span> — delivered at account opening, explaining:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What information is collected</li>
                        <li>How it will be used</li>
                        <li>With whom it may be shared</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Annual Privacy Notice</span> — provided every year the account remains open</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Opt-Out Rights</h3>

            <p>Customers have the right to <span class="key-term">opt out</span> of having their information shared with <strong>non-affiliated third parties</strong>. However, they cannot opt out of information sharing with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Affiliated companies (within the same corporate family)</li>
                <li>Third parties processing transactions</li>
                <li>Regulatory agencies</li>

                <p>Regulation S-P also includes the <span class="key-term">Safeguards Rule</span>, requiring firms to protect customer information from unauthorized access. This means implementing security measures for both physical records and electronic data.</p>

            <h3>Discretionary Accounts</h3>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">discretionary account</span> gives the representative authority to make trading decisions without consulting the customer for each transaction. This is a significant grant of trust—and one that has been abused.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>Discretionary authority has been at the heart of numerous scandals. In the churning cases of the 1990s, some brokers made hundreds of trades per year in elderly clients' accounts—not because the trading strategy required it, but because each trade generated commissions. One notorious case involved 300 trades in a widow's account in a single year. That's why discretionary accounts have strict requirements.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Requirements for Discretionary Authority</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Written authorization</strong> from the customer is required</li>
                <li>The authorization form must be <strong>approved by a principal</strong></li>
                <li>Each discretionary order must be <strong>identified as such</strong> when entered</li>
                <li>All discretionary orders must be <strong>reviewed by a principal</strong> on the day entered</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What's NOT Discretionary</h3>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> If a customer gives a representative authority over <strong>time and/or price only</strong>, this is NOT considered discretionary. Why? The customer has still decided what to buy or sell—they've just given the rep flexibility on execution. Example: "Buy 100 shares of Apple sometime today when you think the price is right" = NOT discretionary.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Discretion over asset, action, or amount</strong> = Discretionary account required</p>
            <p><strong>Discretion over time and price only</strong> = NOT discretionary (good for same day only)</p>

        <!-- SECTION 7: EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS -->
        <section id="employee-accounts">
            <h2>Accounts for Employees of Other Firms</h2>

            <p>
                When opening an account for someone employed by another FINRA member firm, special rules apply to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure proper oversight.
            </p>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Written notification</strong> — The employing firm must be notified in writing before or promptly after opening the account</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicate statements</strong> — Upon request from the employer, duplicate account statements and confirmations must be sent to the employing firm</li>
                <li><strong>Employer may refuse</strong> — The employing firm can instruct you not to open the account for their employee</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Why These Rules Exist</div>
                <p>Firms want to know if their employees are trading elsewhere. An employee with accounts at multiple firms might be front-running, manipulating markets, or engaging in other problematic behavior that would be harder to detect without consolidated oversight.</p>
