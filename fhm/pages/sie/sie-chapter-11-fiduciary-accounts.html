            <p>
                In 1830, a Harvard treasurer named Samuel Gridley Howe faced a novel legal question: when you manage someone else's money, exactly what obligations do you have? The resulting Massachusetts court case, Harvard College v. Amory, established what we now call the "prudent person rule"—a standard that still governs fiduciary accounts today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The principle is deceptively simple: manage other people's money with the same care a prudent person would use with their own. But defining "prudent" has kept lawyers employed for nearly two centuries.

        <!-- SECTION 1: REQUIREMENTS -->
        <section id="requirements">
            <h2>Requirements for Fiduciary Accounts</h2>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">fiduciary</span> is someone who manages assets for another person's benefit—and must put that person's interests before their own. It's a legal obligation, not just a nice idea. Courts have been enforcing fiduciary duties since medieval England, and the securities industry takes them seriously. Breach your fiduciary duty, and you'll face both civil liability and regulatory consequences.
            </p>

            <p>Types of fiduciary accounts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Custodial accounts (UGMA/UTMA)</li>
                <li>Guardian accounts</li>
                <li>Trust accounts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Documentation Comes First</h3>

            <p>
                Fiduciary accounts can't be opened without proper documentation appointing the fiduciary. No court order? No guardian account. No trust agreement? No trust account.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">KEY RULE: TRADING AUTHORITY</div>
                <p>Since the fiduciary is a third party handling someone else's money, <strong>only the fiduciary can trade</strong> in the account. They cannot delegate that authority to another person—unless the account documents specifically permit it (for example, allowing an outside registered investment adviser to manage the account).</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Cash Only (Usually)</h3>

            <div class="exam-focus">
                <div class="exam-focus__label">EXAM FOCUS - FREQUENTLY TESTED</div>
                <p><strong>Fiduciary accounts are generally CASH ONLY.</strong> Margin transactions are prohibited unless the documents appointing the fiduciary explicitly authorize them. The logic: leverage creates risk, and fiduciaries have a duty to protect assets, not gamble with them.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Prudent Person Rule</h3>

            <p>Fiduciaries don't have free rein over investments. State law typically requires them to follow one of two standards:</p>

            <div class="comparison-table">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Standard</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            <th>Flexibility</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>

                            <td>Only investments that a "prudent person" would make are permitted</td>
                            <td>More flexible — based on overall approach</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>More restrictive — if not on list, not allowed</td>

                    </tbody>
                </table>

        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2: POWER OF ATTORNEY -->
        <section id="poa">
            <h2>Power of Attorney</h2>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">power of attorney (POA)</span> isn't an account type—it's a grant of authority. It allows someone to act on behalf of an account owner.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">full POA</span> allows the agent to trade <em>and</em> make withdrawals. A <span class="key-term">limited POA</span> might restrict actions to trading only.

        <!-- SECTION 3: CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS -->
        <section id="custodial">
            <h2>Custodial Accounts (UGMA/UTMA)</h2>

            <p>
                Custodial accounts allow an adult to manage investments on behalf of a minor. The adult has trading authority; the minor is the legal owner.
            </p>

            <p>Two types dominate: <span class="key-term">UGMA</span> and <span class="key-term">UTMA</span>.</p>

            <h3>UGMA: Uniform Gifts to Minors Act</h3>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>UGMA was created in 1956 to simplify gifts to minors. Before UGMA, giving securities to a child required establishing a formal trust—expensive and complicated. UGMA created a standardized, simple custodial arrangement that any adult could establish at any brokerage firm.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Key features of UGMA accounts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One custodian, one minor</strong> per account</li>
                <li>The custodian must be an adult; they don't need to be related to the minor</li>
                <li>The minor is the <strong>legal owner</strong> of all assets</li>
                <li>Account is opened under the <strong>minor's Social Security number</strong></li>
                <li>Gifts are <span class="key-term">irrevocable</span>—once given, they cannot be taken back</li>
                <li>Gifts can be cash or fully paid securities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When the minor reaches the <span class="key-term">age of majority</span> (varies by state—typically 18 or 21), full control of the assets transfers to them. No exceptions.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Investment limitations</strong>: UGMA accounts can only hold financial assets—stocks, bonds, mutual funds. No real estate. No collectibles. No uncovered options.</p>

            <h3>UTMA: Uniform Transfers to Minors Act</h3>

            <p>UTMA expanded on UGMA with two key differences:</p>

            <h3>The Kiddie Tax</h3>

            <div class="exam-focus">
                <div class="exam-focus__label">TAX RULES FOR CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dividends, interest, and capital gains are <strong>unearned income</strong></li>
                    <li>A portion is taxed at the <strong>minor's rate</strong> (usually low)</li>
                    <li>Above threshold, the <strong>parent's/guardian's rate</strong> applies</li>
                    <li>Regardless of rate, taxes are the <strong>child's responsibility</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The IRS designed these rules—often called the <span class="key-term">"kiddie tax"</span>—to prevent wealthy parents from shifting investment income to children in lower tax brackets.
            </p>

            <h3>Death of a Minor</h3>

            <p>
                If the minor dies before reaching adulthood, the assets pass to the <strong>minor's estate</strong>—not directly to the parents. This can create estate complications.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Don't confuse UGMA/UTMA accounts with ABLE accounts. <span class="key-term">ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) accounts</span> are for people with disabilities and can be established for either a child or an adult up to age 26. Different purpose entirely.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 4: GUARDIAN ACCOUNTS -->
        <section id="guardian">
            <h2>Guardian Accounts</h2>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">guardian account</span> is for situations where a court has intervened—either to protect a minor's assets or to manage finances for an adult who lacks mental capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key difference from custodial accounts: <strong>court appointment is required</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To open a guardian account, the firm needs a copy of the court order appointing the guardian. The account cannot be opened only in the name of the minor or incompetent adult—the guardian must be part of the registration.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 5: TRUST ACCOUNTS -->
        <section id="trust">
            <h2>Trust Accounts</h2>

            <p>Trusts are the most flexible—and complex—fiduciary structure.</p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>The trust concept dates to medieval England, where Crusaders leaving for the Holy Land needed someone to manage their estates while they were away (or, more commonly, dead). The "use" or trust allowed property to be held by one person for the benefit of another—a structure that survived eight centuries of legal evolution to become the foundation of modern estate planning.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The basic architecture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Grantor</span> (also called trustor, donor, or settlor): Creates the trust and transfers assets</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Trustee</span>: Manages the assets according to the trust's terms</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Beneficiary</span>: Eventually receives the assets</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Opening a Trust Account</h3>

            <p>The firm needs a copy of the <span class="key-term">trust agreement</span>, which specifies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What transactions the trustee can perform</li>
                <li>Who has trading authority</li>
                <li>Whether margin is permitted (prohibited unless specifically authorized)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Key Point</div>
                <p>The grantor can appoint themselves as trustee. Many living trusts work this way—the same person creates the trust, manages it, and benefits from it during their lifetime.</p>

            <p>
                The most common form is the <span class="key-term">revocable living trust</span>—a trust that can be revoked at any time before death. Advantage: flexibility. Disadvantage: no estate tax savings.

                <li>Donor receives fixed income from the trust during their lifetime</li>
                <li>After death, remaining assets go to the charity</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                CRTs are <strong>irrevocable</strong>—once established, they can't be undone. The donor gives up ownership but gains a steady income stream and a charitable tax deduction.

        <!-- SUMMARY -->
        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary &amp; Key Points</h2>

            <p>
                Fiduciary accounts exist because not everyone can—or should—manage their own investments. Whether it's a minor who can't legally trade, an incompetent adult who needs protection, or a grantor who wants professional management, fiduciary structures provide the legal framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                The common thread: someone is responsible for managing assets in another person's best interest. That responsibility is legally enforceable—and the securities industry has specific rules about how these accounts must be opened and operated.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> For custodial accounts, remember "one and one"—one custodian, one minor. Also remember that UGMA = financial assets only; UTMA = can include real estate and allows delayed transfer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-terms">
                <h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fiduciary accounts are generally cash-only</strong> — no margin without specific authorization</li>
                    <li><strong>UGMA vs. UTMA</strong> — UTMA allows real estate and delayed transfers</li>
                    <li><strong>POA ceases at death</strong> — both durable and nondurable</li>
                    <li><strong>Revocable trusts don't avoid estate taxes</strong> — assets still in grantor's estate</li>
                    <li><strong>Testamentary trusts don't avoid probate</strong> — created through a will</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Terms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="key-term">Fiduciary</span>: Person who manages assets for another's benefit</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">UGMA</span>: Uniform Gifts to Minors Act — custodial account for financial assets</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">UTMA</span>: Uniform Transfers to Minors Act — allows real estate, delayed transfer</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">Revocable Trust</span>: Can be changed; assets remain in grantor's estate</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">Irrevocable Trust</span>: Cannot be changed; removes assets from estate</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Custodial accounts: One custodian, one minor</li>
                    <li>POA terminates at grantor's death (all types)</li>
                    <li>Fiduciary accounts: Cash only unless documents authorize margin</li>
                    <li>Minors can sue custodians for mismanagement</li>
