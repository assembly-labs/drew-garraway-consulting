            <p>
                In 1952, TIAA-CREF created the first variable annuity for college professors worried that their fixed pensions wouldn't keep pace with inflation. The concept was revolutionary: instead of a guaranteed fixed payment, retirement income would rise and fall with the stock market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Variable annuities now come with surrender charges, mortality and expense fees, subaccount options, guaranteed minimum death benefits, and more riders than a motorcycle gang. Understanding these products is essential because they sit at the intersection of insurance and securities regulation—and because unsuitable annuity sales remain one of FINRA's top enforcement priorities.

        <!-- SECTION 1: ANNUITY BASICS -->
        <section id="annuity-basics">
            <h2>Annuity Basics</h2>

            <p>
                An <span class="key-term">annuity</span> is an investment contract between an individual and an insurance company. The owner invests money with the insurance company, either as a lump sum or in periodic payments. When the owner reaches retirement age, the insurance company will begin distributing payments.
            </p>

            <h3>Fixed Annuity: Guaranteed Rate of Return</h3>
            <p>
                In a <span class="key-term">fixed annuity</span> contract, the insurer guarantees a specific rate of return. The insurance company invests premiums into the company's <span class="key-term">general account</span>. Because the insurance company assumes the investment risk, a fixed annuity is <strong>not considered a security</strong>—it's an insurance product only.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Indexed annuities</span> track an index and pay returns based on that index's performance. They are also considered fixed annuities and not subject to securities laws.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fixed annuities expose annuitants to <span class="key-term">purchasing power risk</span> (or <span class="key-term">inflation risk</span>)—the risk that fixed payments will be worth less in real terms over time.
            </p>

            <h3>Variable Annuity: No Guaranteed Rate of Return</h3>
            <p>
                In a <span class="key-term">variable annuity</span> contract, there is no guarantee of a specific rate of return. Customers choose from a menu of mutual fund-like investments. If investments perform well, the annuity value increases; if poorly, it decreases.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">KEY DISTINCTION</div>
                <p>Since the investor selects the investment vehicles, <strong>variable annuities are considered securities</strong> regulated under securities laws. They must be sold with a prospectus.</p>
                <p>Sellers of variable annuities must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>State registered to sell insurance products</li>
                    <li>Registered to sell securities (Series 6 or Series 7)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- SECTION 2: PHASES -->
        <section id="annuity-phases">
            <h2>Variable Annuity Phases</h2>

            <p>
                Funds from variable annuities are held in <span class="key-term">separate accounts</span>, apart from the insurance company's general account. Within separate accounts, investors choose from <span class="key-term">subaccounts</span> that operate like mutual funds. The investor bears the investment risk.
            </p>

            <h3>Accumulation Phase</h3>
            <p>
                During this phase, the customer contributes money and purchases <span class="key-term">accumulation units</span>. These units grow (or shrink) based on investment performance.
            </p>

            <h3>Distribution Phase</h3>
            <p>
                When the customer begins receiving payments, they may take a lump sum, make random withdrawals, or <span class="key-term">annuitize</span> the contract.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon annuitization, the customer becomes an <span class="key-term">annuitant</span>. Accumulation units convert to a fixed number of <span class="key-term">annuity units</span> based on life expectancy. Monthly payments depend on investment performance, age/sex, and payout option selected.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Tax Treatment</div>
                <p>Contributions are typically made with after-tax dollars. Earnings grow tax-deferred. There is a 10% penalty on earnings withdrawn before age 59½. Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn.</p>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">surrender period</span> is the time the investor must wait before withdrawing without penalty (up to 10 years). Withdrawing early triggers a <span class="key-term">surrender fee</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">free-look period</span> allows customers to cancel the policy within a certain time (typically 10+ days) at no charge.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Customers who need income in the near future, such as the elderly, should not consider deferred annuities. This is a key suitability consideration.</p>

            <h3>Taxation</h3>
            <p>
                In a <span class="key-term">nonqualified annuity</span>, contributions are after-tax. Earnings are taxed as ordinary income. Annuitized payments are split between taxable earnings and tax-free return of principal.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a <span class="key-term">qualified annuity</span> (like a 403(b)), contributions are pre-tax. All withdrawals are fully taxable.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Withdrawals from any retirement plan or variable insurance product are never subject to capital gains taxes—only ordinary income.</p>

            <h2>Variable Life Insurance</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Variable life insurance</span> is an insurance product that is also a security. Premiums are deposited into a separate account, and the death benefit varies with investment performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Variable life is <span class="key-term">permanent insurance</span>—as long as premiums are paid, the policy stays in force. The premium amount is fixed, but the death benefit and <span class="key-term">cash value</span> (amount that can be borrowed or withdrawn) vary.
