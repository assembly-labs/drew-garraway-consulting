                On March 15, 1985, a husband and wife in New Jersey learned an expensive lesson about account registration. The husband died, and his wife assumed she'd inherit their joint brokerage account automatically. She was wrong. Their account was registered as "tenancy in common"—which meant his half went to his estate, not to her. The probate process took eighteen months and cost $47,000 in legal fees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two words on an account form. Eighteen months of headaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Account registration matters. Whether it's a married couple's joint account, a corporation's investment holdings, or an individual's options trading account, the type of account determines the paperwork required, the authority structure, and what happens when circumstances change.

            <h2>Joint Accounts</h2>

            <p>When more than one person owns an account, things get more complicated.</p>

            <p>
                All parties need to provide new account information. All parties can access the account and trade independently. And here's one that catches people: <strong>any check issued must be made payable to all parties</strong> on the account.
            </p>

            <p>But the real question—the one that matters most—is what happens when one owner dies.</p>

            <p>
                The name tells you what matters: <span class="key-term">rights of survivorship</span>. If one party dies, the surviving owner automatically becomes sole owner. No lawyers. No court proceedings. No delays.

                <div class="info-box__title">Why Probate Matters</div>
                <p><span class="key-term">Probate</span> is the court process of validating a will and distributing assets. It's time-consuming (often months), expensive (legal fees), and public (anyone can see the details). JTWROS avoids all of that.</p>

            <p>
                This structure makes sense for business partners. If you're running a business with someone, you might not want your investment account to automatically go to them when you die—you want it to go to your heirs.

            <p>Like a corporate resolution, the partnership agreement is the source of authority. No agreement? No account.</p>

            <h3>Investment Adviser Accounts</h3>

            <p>
                An <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span> manages money for clients in exchange for a fee. They're <span class="key-term">fiduciaries</span>—legally required to put clients' interests first.
            </p>

            <p>Investment adviser accounts typically work like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Account held in the <strong>client's name</strong></li>
                <li>Adviser has <span class="key-term">discretionary authority</span> to trade</li>
                <li>Adviser makes most decisions without calling the client first</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Omnibus Accounts</div>
                <p>When an adviser has many clients, they might open an <span class="key-term">omnibus account</span>—a single account in the adviser's name holding all clients' securities. The adviser keeps internal records of who owns what. Opening requires individual new account forms for each client, plus third-party trading authorization.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Prime Brokerage Accounts</h3>

            <p>
                Hedge funds and institutions often trade through multiple broker-dealers called <span class="key-term">executing brokers</span>. A <span class="key-term">prime broker</span> centralizes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Settlement of trades from all executing brokers</li>
                <li>Custody of assets</li>
                <li>Reporting and record-keeping</li>
                <li>Protection of the institution's trading strategy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Prime brokerage is an institutional service. Individual investors don't use it.</p>

            <h3>Wrap Accounts</h3>

            <p>A <span class="key-term">wrap account</span> bundles everything—management, trading, custody, administration—into a single fee.</p>

            <p>The appeal for clients: simplicity and aligned incentives. The adviser doesn't make more money by trading more.</p>

        <section id="options">
            <h2>Options Accounts</h2>

            <p>Options are different. More complex. More risky. And therefore, more regulated.</p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) opened in 1973, creating the first standardized, exchange-traded options market. Before that, options were bespoke contracts traded between institutions. The Cboe brought options to retail investors—and with that access came the need for suitability standards and approval processes that didn't exist for regular stock trading.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe)</span> and the <span class="key-term">Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)</span> impose specific requirements beyond standard FINRA rules.
            </p>

            <h3>Opening Requirements</h3>

            <p>To open an options account, the customer must provide information about:</p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">OPTIONS ACCOUNT INFORMATION REQUIRED</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investment objective</li>
                    <li>Investment experience</li>
                    <li>Financial situation</li>
                    <li>Financial needs</li>
                    <li>Marital status</li>
                    <li>Net worth</li>
                    <li>Liquid net worth</li>
                    <li>Estimated annual income</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> If a customer refuses to disclose required information, the registered representative must note "not disclosed" for each item. The approving manager then decides whether to open the account anyway. Limited information typically means limited approval—or no approval.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Options Agreement</h3>

            <p>
                Cboe requires the customer receive a copy of the <span class="key-term">options agreement</span> before trading. By signing, the customer agrees to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abide by any trading restrictions the firm imposes</li>
                <li>Follow OCC rules (position limits, exercise limits)</li>
                <li>Update the firm if their financial situation changes materially</li>

            <p><strong>Timing</strong>: The ODD must be delivered by the date of the principal's approval—not later.</p>

                If approved, all statements and confirmations will be <strong>automatically sent to the employing broker-dealer</strong>. This prevents representatives from hiding trading activity from their compliance departments.

        <!-- SUMMARY -->
        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary &amp; Key Points</h2>

            <p>
                Account registration determines authority, documentation requirements, and outcomes when circumstances change. Joint accounts pass differently depending on whether they're JTWROS (survivor takes all) or tenancy in common (estate inherits). Business accounts require specific authorization documents. Options accounts need additional approval steps and disclosures.
            </p>

            <p>
                The details matter. Two words on an account form—"rights of survivorship" or "tenancy in common"—can mean the difference between a seamless transfer and eighteen months of probate.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> For joint accounts, remember: JTWROS = survivor takes all, avoids probate (think SPOUSES). Tenancy in common = percentage interest, goes to estate (think BUSINESS PARTNERS).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-terms">
                <h3>Key Points to Remember</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JTWROS vs. Tenancy in Common</strong> — survivor vs. estate; probate avoided vs. required</li>
                    <li><strong>TOD</strong> — avoids probate like JTWROS but owner keeps full control until death</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate accounts</strong> — need corporate resolution naming authorized traders</li>
                    <li><strong>Options accounts</strong> — final approval from registered options principal</li>
                    <li><strong>15-day rule</strong> — no new positions if signed agreement not returned</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Terms</h3>

                    <li><span class="key-term">Tenancy in Common</span>: Each party owns percentage; estate inherits at death</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">TOD</span>: Transfer on Death — passes to beneficiary, avoids probate</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">Corporate Resolution</span>: Document authorizing corporate account and traders</li>
