                    In the early 2000s, FINRA investigators discovered a disturbing pattern: brokers were selling
                    variable annuities with 15-year surrender periods to customers in their mid-80s. The math didn't
                    work—these customers would likely need access to their money for healthcare costs long before the
                    surrender period ended, or wouldn't be alive to benefit from the product's features. But the
                    commissions were excellent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One reason for collecting all that new account information is to ensure that future recommendations
                    will be suitable for a particular customer. All regulators—including FINRA, the MSRB, and the
                    SEC—have established suitability standards. And Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) is now the
                    ultimate standard for client suitability.

                        Quantitative suitability exists because of churning scandals. A single trade might be perfectly
                        suitable, but executing 300 trades per year in a conservative investor's account is
                        not—regardless of whether each individual trade was reasonable. The pattern matters.

                <p>
                    Suitability obligations apply when a representative makes a
                    <span class="key-term">recommendation</span>. They do NOT apply to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsolicited orders (customer initiates without recommendation)</li>
                    <li>Self-directed accounts where the customer makes all decisions</li>
                    <li>Institutional investors who affirmatively indicate they're exercising independent judgment</li>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> If an exam question describes a customer who places an order without
                        any recommendation from the rep, suitability rules don't apply to that transaction. The key word
                        is "recommendation."

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest</span> is an SEC rule that establishes a higher
                    standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers. It went into
                    effect in June 2020.

                <div class="historical-note">

                    <p>
                        Reg BI rose from the ashes of a regulatory battle. In 2016, the Department of Labor finalized a
                        "fiduciary rule" requiring brokers to act as fiduciaries when advising retirement accounts. The
                        securities industry challenged it in court—and won. In 2018, the Fifth Circuit struck down the
                        DOL rule as overreach. But the underlying problem remained: brokers could legally recommend
                        products that paid them higher commissions even when better alternatives existed. The SEC
                        stepped in with Reg BI as a middle ground—stronger than the old "suitability" standard, but not
                        a full fiduciary duty. Critics called it a compromise; the SEC called it workable. Either way,
                        it's now the law.

                <h3>The Care Obligation in Detail</h3>

                <p>The Care Obligation requires representatives to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs of a recommendation</li>
                    <li>Have a reasonable basis to believe the recommendation is in the customer's best interest</li>
                    <li>Consider reasonably available alternatives</li>

                    <p>
                        Reg BI requires acting in the customer's "best interest"—but it doesn't impose a full fiduciary
                        duty like investment advisers have. Broker-dealers can still receive transaction-based
                        compensation (commissions), but they must mitigate the conflicts this creates.

                <h2>Form CRS: Customer Relationship Summary</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Form CRS</span> (Customer Relationship Summary) is a disclosure document that
                    broker-dealers and investment advisers must provide to retail investors.

                    <p>
                        Form CRS exists because investors couldn't tell the difference between a broker and an
                        investment adviser—and the industry wasn't eager to explain. A 2006 RAND study commissioned by
                        the SEC found that retail investors were deeply confused about who they were working with, what
                        services they were getting, and what legal duties applied. Investors thought their "financial
                        advisor" (a marketing term, not a legal one) was looking out for them—when that person might be
                        a broker with no fiduciary duty at all. Form CRS, adopted alongside Reg BI in 2019, forces firms
                        to explain the relationship in plain English. Four pages maximum, prescribed format, no fine
                        print evasion.

                        recommendation—not after. This ensures the customer has information about the relationship
                        before making decisions based on recommendations.

                <h2>Continuing Maintenance of Accounts</h2>

                <p>
                    Once an account is open, firms have ongoing obligations to keep customers informed about their
                    accounts and transactions.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        Before the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the secondary market was the Wild West. Major
                        companies like Westinghouse and Singer didn't even publish income statements or balance sheets.
                        Brokers could execute trades and customers might never know what they paid in commissions—or
                        even what price they got. After the 1929 crash revealed how much manipulation and fraud had
                        flourished in this opacity, Congress mandated transparency. Trade confirmations, account
                        statements, and disclosure requirements all flow from this principle: investors have a right to
                        know what's happening in their accounts. Every piece of paper your firm sends is a descendant of
                        Depression-era reforms.

                    Statements must include a legend telling customers to promptly report any inaccuracies or
                    discrepancies to the firm. The phone number given <strong>cannot</strong> be that of the
                    representative.

                <h3>Customer Mail</h3>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Firms cannot generally hold customer mail.</span> Statements and
                    confirmations must be sent to the address on the new account form or a P.O. Box designated by the
                    customer. Customer mail <strong>cannot</strong> be directed to the registered representative's
                    office.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The mail hold restrictions exist because fraudsters discovered a simple trick: if you control
                        the mail, you control what the customer knows. Dishonest brokers would have statements sent to
                        their own offices, intercept them, and hide unauthorized trading, churning, or outright
                        theft—sometimes for years. By the time the customer discovered the problem, the money was long
                        gone. FINRA's strict limits on holding mail ensure that statements reach customers directly,
                        making fraud much harder to conceal. The three-month exception exists for legitimate reasons
                        (like customers traveling abroad), but "convenience" explicitly doesn't qualify.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Exception:</strong> If the customer requests in writing, mail can be held for up to
                    <strong>3 months</strong>. If the customer wants mail held longer, their written instruction must
                    include an acceptable reason (e.g., safety or security concerns). FINRA states that
                    <strong>convenience is NOT an acceptable reason</strong> for holding mail longer than 3 months.
                </p>

                <h3>Business Continuity Plans</h3>

                <p>
                    FINRA requires firms to create and maintain a
                    <span class="key-term">Business Continuity Plan (BCP)</span> that identifies procedures to follow if
                    there is an emergency or significant business disruption.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The BCP requirement emerged directly from September 11, 2001. When the towers fell, they took
                        out critical financial infrastructure—backup generators, communication systems, and trading
                        floors. The securities industry showed impressive resilience in recovering, but regulators saw
                        vulnerabilities. What if the next disruption was worse? In 2004, FINRA (then NASD) adopted rules
                        requiring every member firm to have a written business continuity plan. The goal: ensure that
                        customer accounts remain accessible even when buildings don't.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>The BCP disclosure must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provided to customers in writing at account opening</li>
                    <li>Posted on the firm's website</li>
                    <li>Mailed to customers on request</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>
                        If a registered representative leaves a broker-dealer for any reason, all accounts are
                        considered to be the property of the firm. The broker-dealer will allocate the departing
                        representative's accounts among existing representatives.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    If a customer wishes to transfer to another broker at the <strong>same firm</strong>, the branch
                    manager must approve. No new account form is required. However,
                    <span class="key-term">discretionary power cannot be transferred</span>—the client must provide new
                    written authorization.

                <h3>Proxy Materials</h3>

                <p>
                    Securities held in <span class="key-term">street name</span> (registered in the broker-dealer's
                    name) require the firm to forward all issuer communications to the beneficial owner. The SEC
                    requires companies to send shareholders a <span class="key-term">proxy statement</span> prior to
                    every stockholders' meeting, covering:

                <p>
                    FINRA has stated that a customer's age and life stage are important factors when determining
                    suitability. As investors age, their investment time horizons, goals, risk tolerance, and tax status
                    often change, and liquidity takes on added importance.

                <h3>Trusted Contact Person</h3>

                <p>
                    FINRA requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name and contact information of a
                    <span class="key-term">trusted contact person</span> when opening an account.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The trusted contact requirement (FINRA Rule 4512, effective February 2018) addresses a
                        frustrating gap that brokers faced for years. A representative would notice signs that an
                        elderly client was being exploited—perhaps by a caregiver or family member—but had no one to
                        call. Privacy rules prevented sharing account information with anyone except the customer.
                        Meanwhile, the exploitation continued. The trusted contact person gives firms a lifeline:
                        someone they can call to verify the customer's wellbeing without violating privacy rules. It's
                        not a power of attorney. It's more like an emergency contact for your money.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>The firm is authorized to contact this person to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disclose information about the client's account to address possible financial exploitation</li>
                    <li>Confirm the client's current contact information or health status</li>
                    <li>
                        Obtain the identity of any legal guardian, executor, trustee, or holder of a power of attorney
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Diminished Mental Capacity</h3>

                <p>Firms must train employees to identify diminished mental capacity. When suspected:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Document suspicions</strong> and escalate immediately to a designated individual</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop trading</strong> in the account until the concern no longer exists</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate</strong> with the customer's emergency contact or power of attorney</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain frequent contact</strong> with the investor and notify legal/compliance</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Consult state statutes</strong> to determine next steps, which may include alerting
                        government protective services
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Financial Exploitation Holds</h3>

                <p>
                    FINRA allows firms to place temporary holds on disbursements when fraud is suspected.
                    <span class="key-term">Specified adults</span> are individuals particularly susceptible to
                    exploitation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals aged <strong>65 or older</strong>; or</li>
                    <li>
                        Individuals aged <strong>18 or older</strong> with a mental or physical impairment affecting
                        their ability to protect their own interests
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        FINRA Rule 2165 (effective February 2018) solved a legal catch-22. Before this rule, if a broker
                        suspected a customer was being exploited and refused to process a suspicious disbursement, the
                        broker could be sued for breach of contract. But if they processed it and the money disappeared
                        to a scammer, they'd face regulatory scrutiny for failing to protect a vulnerable customer. Rule
                        2165 created a "safe harbor"—firms can now place temporary holds on suspicious disbursements
                        without legal liability, giving them time to investigate. Every year, millions of seniors lose
                        billions of dollars to financial exploitation. This rule gives firms a tool to fight back.
