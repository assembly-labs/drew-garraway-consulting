                Municipal bonds: where local governments turn their promises into IOUs that somehow
                become tax-free income for investors. It's a beautiful system where cities get to build
                schools, and you get to keep more of your investment returns. Win-win, assuming the city
                doesn't pull a Detroit circa 2013.

                This chapter covers how municipalities borrow money, the different flavors of municipal debt,
                and why your wealthy uncle keeps talking about "munis" at Thanksgiving dinner.

            <h2>The Basics: Why Cities Borrow Money</h2>

            <p>
                The major appeal of municipal debt isn't the excitement of funding sewage treatment plants—it's the
                <span class="key-term">preferential tax treatment</span> on the interest income. When Uncle Sam
                decided to encourage infrastructure investment, he made muni bond interest exempt from federal taxes.
                Smart move, considering the alternative was letting bridges collapse.
            </p>

            <p>Who issues municipal debt? Pretty much any government entity smaller than the federal government:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Counties (yes, even yours)</li>
                <li>Parishes (Louisiana likes to be different)</li>
                <li>Cities</li>
                <li>Towns</li>
                <li>Boroughs</li>
                <li>Water, sewer, and school districts</li>
                <li>Transportation authorities (someone has to fix those potholes)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>
                    The tax exemption for municipal bonds dates back to 1913, the same year the 16th Amendment
                    created federal income tax. The Supreme Court initially ruled that the federal government
                    couldn't tax state and local bonds based on the doctrine of "reciprocal immunity"—basically,
                    "you don't tax us, we don't tax you." This principle held until 1988, when South Carolina v. Baker
                    said Congress could tax munis if it wanted to. So far, it hasn't wanted to. Lucky us.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Characteristics -->
        <section id="characteristics">
            <h2>Municipal Debt Characteristics</h2>

            <p>
                Municipal securities operate in their own special world. They're exempt from federal regulations
                (thanks to the Tower Amendment of 1975), but don't worry—the
                <span class="key-term">Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)</span> keeps broker-dealers
                in line. The issuers themselves? They're "self-governing," which works about as well as you'd expect.
            </p>

            <h3>The Official Statement (Not a Prospectus)</h3>
            <p>
                Since munis are exempt from registration, issuers don't publish a prospectus. Instead, they offer an
                <span class="key-term">official statement</span>—think of it as a prospectus that went to community
                college instead of Harvard. Less detailed, but it gets the job done. Firms must give customers this
                document by trade confirmation.
            </p>

            <h3>Legal Opinion: The Lawyer's Blessing</h3>
            <p>
                Every municipal issue needs a <span class="key-term">legal opinion</span>. The municipality hires
                a law firm as <span class="key-term">bond counsel</span> to verify three things:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legality:</strong> Yes, this is actually legal and binding</li>
                <li><strong>Validity:</strong> The municipality can actually do this</li>
                <li><strong>Tax-exempt status:</strong> The IRS won't come knocking (hopefully)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Legal opinions come in two flavors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Qualified:</strong> "This looks fine, BUT..." (investors hate this)</li>
                <li><strong>Unqualified:</strong> "All good, no problems here" (investors love this)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>💡 Test Tip:</strong> Remember that issuers want an unqualified legal opinion.
                    It's counterintuitive—usually "qualified" sounds better than "unqualified," but not here.
                    Think of it this way: unqualified = unconditional approval.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Bond Contract</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond the legal opinion, municipal bonds need a bond contract with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <span class="key-term">bond resolution</span> authorizing the sale</li>
                <li>A security agreement pledging revenue sources (taxes for GO bonds, project revenue for revenue bonds)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: GO Bonds -->
        <section id="go-bonds">
            <h2>General Obligation (GO) Bonds</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">General Obligation bonds</span> are the municipal bond world's blue chips.
                They're backed by the "full faith, credit, and taxing power" of the issuer—which is a fancy way
                of saying "we'll raise taxes if we have to." These are typically backed by
                <span class="key-term">ad valorem taxes</span> (property taxes, from the Latin meaning "according to value").
            </p>

            <p>
                Most GO bonds are backed by <strong>unlimited</strong> ad valorem taxes, meaning the municipality
                can raise property taxes without limit to pay bondholders. Homeowners love this feature.
                (That's sarcasm, in case you missed it.)
            </p>

            <h3>Limited Tax Bonds</h3>
            <p>
                Some issuers sell <span class="key-term">limited tax bonds</span> with a cap on tax rates.
                These carry more risk and higher yields because there's a chance the issuer might not collect
                enough to service the debt. It's like lending money to someone who promises to pay you back
                but only from their allowance.
            </p>

            <h3>Debt Limits</h3>
            <p>
                Many municipalities have a <span class="key-term">statutory debt limit</span>—a maximum amount
                of GO bonds they can have outstanding. Once they hit this ceiling, they need legislative action
                or a public referendum to issue more. It's like a credit limit, but for cities.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>
                    The concept of debt limits gained traction after the Great Depression when numerous
                    municipalities defaulted. Arkansas had the dubious honor of the highest default rate—about
                    44% of its local governments defaulted during the 1930s. This led to widespread adoption
                    of constitutional debt limits. Today, only about 10 states have no debt limits at all.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Capital Appreciation Bonds (CABs)</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">CABs</span> are zero-coupon municipal bonds with a clever twist: only
                the discounted purchase price counts against the debt limit. Buy a bond for $600,000 that matures
                at $1 million? Only $600,000 hits the debt limit. It's creative accounting that's actually legal.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 4: Revenue Bonds -->
        <section id="revenue-bonds">
            <h2>Revenue Bonds</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Revenue bonds</span> are the entrepreneurs of the muni world. Instead of
                relying on taxes, they're backed by revenue from specific projects—toll roads, hospitals,
                sports stadiums, parking garages. No tax increases required, which makes voters happy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The catch? If the project fails to generate enough revenue, bondholders can't force the city
                to raise taxes. You're betting on the project's success, not the municipality's ability to
                squeeze taxpayers.
            </p>

            <h3>Feasibility Studies</h3>
            <p>
                Before issuing revenue bonds, municipalities conduct a <span class="key-term">feasibility study</span>.
                Outside consultants (who theoretically have no stake in the outcome) analyze whether the project
                makes economic sense. The study includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Projected operating costs and revenues</li>
                <li>Engineering cost estimates</li>
                <li>Competitive analysis (will people actually use this toll road?)</li>
                <li>Economic projections</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If the feasibility study says "go," bonds get issued. If it says "stop," politicians usually
                find another consultant.
            </p>

            <h3>Trust Indentures</h3>
            <p>
                Most revenue bonds come with a <span class="key-term">trust indenture</span>, even though municipal
                issues are exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Why? Because investors demand protection
                when there's no taxing power to fall back on. The market has spoken: no trust indenture, no sale.
            </p>

                Backed by taxes other than property taxes—usually "sin taxes" on cigarettes, liquor, or gasoline.
                The irony of funding children's hospitals with cigarette taxes isn't lost on anyone.
            </p>

            <h3>Special Assessment Bonds</h3>
            <p>
                Used for improvements that benefit specific areas. New streetlights for Maple Street?
                Maple Street residents pay higher taxes. Democracy in action.
            </p>

            <h3>Moral Obligation Bonds</h3>
            <p>
                The municipality promises to pay but isn't legally required to. It's like an IOU written on a napkin—it might be honored, but you can't sue over it.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">The NYC Crisis Example</div>
                <p>
                    In 1975, New York City hit its debt limit and faced bankruptcy. The state issued moral
                    obligation bonds, essentially saying "We'll probably help if NYC can't pay, but no promises."
                    President Ford's initial response—immortalized in the headline "Ford to City: Drop Dead"—didn't help.
                    The city survived, the bonds paid out, and moral obligation bonds earned their reputation
                    as "maybe bonds."
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Double-Barreled Bonds</h3>
            <p>
                These bonds have two sources of repayment: project revenues first, then taxing power as backup.
                It's like having both a belt and suspenders—one should work, but why risk it?
            </p>

            <h3>Certificates of Participation (COPs)</h3>
            <p>
                A clever workaround for debt limits. The municipality builds a facility, leases it to itself,
                and investors buy shares of the lease payments. It's not technically debt, so it doesn't count
                against debt limits. Accountants love this stuff.
            </p>

            <h3>Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs)</h3>
            <p>
                Municipalities issue these to build facilities for private companies. The company's lease payments
                back the bonds. Since they're for private use, the interest is often federally taxable, defeating
                the whole point of munis. But hey, jobs.
            </p>

            <h3>Build America Bonds (BABs)</h3>
            <p>
                Created during the 2008 financial crisis, these taxable munis came with a 35% federal subsidy
                on interest payments. A 10% BAB cost the issuer only 6.5% after the subsidy. The program ended
                in 2010, probably because someone in Congress did the math on what this was costing.

            <h2>Short-Term Municipal Debt</h2>

            <p>
                Municipalities need short-term financing for the same reason you might need a payday loan—bills
                come due before revenue arrives. Unlike payday loans, these actually have reasonable rates.
            </p>

            <h3>Anticipation Notes</h3>
            <p>
                These are the municipal equivalent of "the check is in the mail." Types include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs):</strong> "We'll pay this off when we issue
                    the real bonds." Used to start projects before final financing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tax Anticipation Notes (TANs):</strong> "We'll pay this off when property
                    taxes come in." Classic cash flow management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANs):</strong> "We'll pay this off when the
                    stadium concession fees arrive."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRANs):</strong> "We'll pay this off
                    when... something comes in." Hedging their bets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs):</strong> "The federal government promised
                    us money." Good luck with that timeline.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Variable Rate Demand Notes</h3>
            <p>
                Long-term financing at short-term rates. The rate resets weekly, and investors can cash out
                at any reset date. It's like a CD that reprices constantly, except it's a bond. The financial
                industry loves making simple things complicated.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>💡 Test Tip:</strong> Remember the anticipation notes by their acronyms. TANs are for Taxes,
                    RANs are for Revenue, BANs are for Bonds. TRANs combine TANs and RANs. GANs are for Grants.
                    The test loves these acronyms.

        <section id="trading">
            <h2>Municipal Debt Trading</h2>

            <p>
                Municipal bonds trade <span class="key-term">over the counter (OTC)</span> in what might be
                the world's quietest market. Most investors buy munis and hold them until maturity or death,
                whichever comes first. This makes for thin trading.
            </p>

            <p>
                Making things worse (or better, depending on your perspective), investors typically buy bonds
                from their own state for maximum tax benefits. Maine residents buy Maine bonds, California
                residents buy California bonds. It's financial provincialism at its finest.
            </p>

            <h3>Settlement</h3>
            <p>
                Both municipal and corporate bonds settle <strong>T+1</strong> (trade date plus one business day) as of May 28, 2024.
                This represents a change from the previous T+2 settlement cycle. Municipal bonds are mostly in book-entry form now,
                making electronic settlement efficient. The days of physical bond certificates are gone,
                taking with them the romance of clipping coupons with actual scissors.
            </p>

            <h3>No Short Selling</h3>
            <p>
                You can't short municipal bonds. The market is too thin—you'd never find bonds to borrow.
                This is probably for the best. Betting against cities and schools isn't a great look anyway.

            <h2>Tax Status (The Good Part)</h2>

            <p>
                Here's why wealthy investors love munis: the interest is <span class="key-term">exempt from
                federal income tax</span>. If you live in the issuing state, it's usually exempt from state
                and local taxes too, achieving the holy grail of <span class="key-term">triple tax-exempt</span> status.
            </p>

            <h3>The Triple Tax-Exempt Dream</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy bonds from your state = no federal, state, or local taxes on interest</li>
                <li>Buy bonds from another state = no federal tax, but state and local taxes apply</li>
                <li>Buy bonds from U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands) = triple tax-exempt for everyone</li>

                    To compare munis with taxable bonds, calculate the tax-equivalent yield. A 4% muni for
                    someone in the 37% tax bracket equals a 6.35% taxable bond (4% ÷ (1 - 0.37)). This is
                    why munis are called "rich people bonds"—the math only works if you're in a high tax bracket.
                    Your barista probably shouldn't buy munis.

            <h2>What to Remember</h2>

            <p>
                Municipal bonds are the steady, tax-advantaged corner of the bond market where cities
                fund boring but essential projects, and investors collect tax-free income.
                It's not exciting, but neither is paying taxes.
            </p>

            <p>Key takeaways for the exam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GO bonds are backed by taxes and are generally safer</li>
                <li>Revenue bonds are backed by project income and carry more risk</li>
                <li>The official statement replaces the prospectus for munis</li>
                <li>Legal opinions should be unqualified (meaning unconditional)</li>
                <li>Interest is federally tax-exempt (the main selling point)</li>
                <li>Triple tax-exempt means no federal, state, or local taxes</li>
                <li>Know your anticipation notes (TANs, RANs, BANs, TRANs, GANs)</li>
                <li>Munis trade OTC, settle T+1, and can't be shorted</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Remember: municipal bonds exist because cities need money and investors hate taxes.
                It's a 100+ year old arrangement that works pretty well, occasional Detroit notwithstanding.
