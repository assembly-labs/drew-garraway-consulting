                <p>
                    On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act into law, just 45 days
                    after the September 11 attacks. Buried inside its 342 pages were provisions that would permanently
                    transform how brokerage firms open accounts. Before that day, opening a brokerage account was
                    roughly as complicated as getting a library card. After it, every new account became a small-scale
                    federal investigation&mdash;verifying identity, checking terrorist watchlists, and documenting the
                    source of funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This chapter covers everything that happens before and after a customer places their first trade:
                    the paperwork, the identity checks, the privacy rules, the suitability analysis, and the ongoing
                    maintenance that keeps an account running properly. It's not the most glamorous material on the
                    Series 7, but it shows up in roughly 14 questions&mdash;and getting these wrong means you don't
                    understand the regulatory framework that every other chapter builds upon.

                    Before opening a new account, a registered representative (RR) is required to gather and record a
                    significant amount of information. This information serves three purposes: establishing the
                    customer's identity, determining suitability for future recommendations, and fulfilling anti-money
                    laundering requirements.

                            Whether the customer is of legal age (note: date of birth is not initially required to
                            <em>open</em> the account, though it will be needed for identity verification)
                        </li>

                    <li>Occupation of customer and address of employer</li>

                <h4>The Predispute Arbitration Agreement</h4>
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        Arbitration became the standard dispute resolution mechanism in the securities industry because
                        lawsuits were expensive, unpredictable, and slow. The industry discovered that mandatory
                        arbitration was a more cost-effective and expedited way to resolve disputes&mdash;and it also
                        kept embarrassing details out of public court records. Today, virtually every firm requires a
                        predispute arbitration agreement before opening an account, even though no FINRA or SEC rule
                        mandates it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here's the key distinction: it is <strong>not mandatory</strong> that a customer sign an arbitration
                    agreement. No FINRA or SEC rule requires it. However, virtually every firm requires one as a
                    condition of opening the account. In practice, if you want to open the account, you're signing the
                    agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most new account forms contain a <span class="key-term">predispute arbitration agreement</span>, in
                    which the customer agrees to resolve disputes with the firm or its associated persons through
                    arbitration rather than litigation.

                <h3>Topic 2: Customer Identification and Verification</h3>

                <h4>The USA PATRIOT Act</h4>
                <p>
                    The <span class="key-term">USA PATRIOT Act</span> requires member firms to independently verify a
                    customer's identity using four pieces of information:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Address</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Date of birth</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Social Security number or tax ID number</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Verification can be done with a government-issued photo ID:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A current driver's license</li>
                    <li>A passport</li>
                    <li>An alien registration card</li>
                    <li>A green card</li>
                    <li>Another government-issued identification</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> A Social Security card is NOT acceptable for identity verification
                        under the PATRIOT Act&mdash;it doesn't have a photo. The exam loves testing this distinction.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>Verification must be completed within a reasonable amount of time after the account is opened.</p>

                <h4>Customer Identification Program (CIP)</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond verifying identity, firms must also check whether the customer appears on a known or
                    suspected terrorist list. Specifically, they must screen against the
                    <span class="key-term">Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list</span>,
                    maintained by the <span class="key-term">Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These rules exist to detect and deter money laundering and the funding of terrorist organizations.
                    Records relating to identification verification must be kept for at least <strong>5 years</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Know Your Customer (KYC)</h4>
                <p>
                    The <span class="key-term">Know Your Customer (KYC)</span> rule requires broker-dealers to use
                    "reasonable diligence" in collecting and maintaining essential information on their customers. The
                    rule requires firms to check:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers' identities</li>
                    <li>Investment histories</li>
                    <li>Investment objectives</li>
                    <li>Sources of funds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This information serves two purposes: ensuring customers aren't engaging in money laundering, and
                    making suitable recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What if the customer doesn't provide everything?</strong> The account may still be opened if
                    the firm collects certain essential facts necessary to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Effectively service a customer's account</li>
                    <li>Carry out special handling instructions for the account</li>
                    <li>Understand who has trading authority on the account</li>
                    <li>Comply with securities laws, regulations, and rules</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When information is missing, a supervisor must be informed. Inquiries should be made and documented
                    as to why the missing information wasn't provided. The supervisor must ensure that no missing
                    information constitutes an essential fact.
                </p>

                <h4>KYC Updates</h4>
                <p>
                    The KYC rule requires firms to make regular contact with customers to check if investment objectives
                    or essential facts have changed. While the SEC requires broker-dealers to update suitability
                    information at least every <strong>3 years</strong>, the KYC obligation may require more frequent
                    updates depending on the circumstances.
                </p>

                <h4>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Requirements</h4>
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        Anti-money laundering rules were first codified under the
                        <span class="key-term">Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</span> in 1970, originally targeting banks. After
                        September 11, 2001, the PATRIOT Act extended these requirements to brokerage firms and other
                        financial institutions. The government recognized that terrorists were exploiting the financial
                        system, and that broker-dealers&mdash;with their ability to move money quickly across borders
                        through securities transactions&mdash;were just as vulnerable as banks.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>The Three Phases of Money Laundering</h4>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p><strong>Money laundering has three phases:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Placement</strong> &mdash; The initial entry of illicit cash into the financial
                        system. Often done by making cash deposits below reporting thresholds, purchasing gambling
                        chips, or mixing dirty money with legitimate business cash.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Layering</strong> &mdash; Once deposited, funds are wired through a series of
                        financial institutions, making them difficult to trace back to their source. This is where the
                        "laundering" really happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3. Integration</strong> &mdash; The final stage, where funds are returned to the
                        criminal from what appear to be legitimate sources. The money is now "clean."
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Think of it as: get the cash in (placement), move it around until nobody can follow the trail
                    (layering), then pull it back out looking legitimate (integration).
                </p>

                <h4>Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)</h4>
                <p>
                    The BSA requires financial institutions to report currency transactions&mdash;deposits or
                    withdrawals of cash&mdash;that exceed <span class="key-term">$10,000</span>. When this threshold is
                    crossed, the institution must file a
                    <span class="key-term">Currency Transaction Report (CTR)</span> with
                    <span class="key-term">FinCEN</span> (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) within
                    <strong>15 days</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Structuring</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Structuring</span> is the practice of making a series of smaller deposits or
                    withdrawals to avoid triggering the $10,000 CTR threshold. It's illegal, and firms are trained to
                    spot it.
                </p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
                    <p>
                        An individual deposits $4,000 in cash at 8:00 a.m., another $4,000 at 1:00 p.m., and another
                        $4,000 at 3:00 p.m. Even though no single deposit exceeds $10,000, the combined total for the
                        day does&mdash;triggering a CTR filing. And if an individual makes repeated deposits under
                        $10,000 over several days, weeks, or even months, and the representative believes this is being
                        done intentionally to avoid reporting, that's still structuring.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    If the $10,000 limit is exceeded AND the firm suspects illegal activity, both an SAR and a CTR must
                    be filed.
                </p>

                <h4>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</h4>
                <p>
                    The BSA requires broker-dealers to file
                    <span class="key-term">Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</span> with FinCEN&mdash;part of the U.S.
                    Department of the Treasury&mdash;which serves as the central collection point for these reports.
                </p>
                <p>Key SAR facts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If potential money laundering or BSA violations are detected or suspected,
                        <strong>for any dollar amount</strong>, a report must be filed within <strong>30 days</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beginning 1/1/2026, firms must notify FinCEN regarding the
                        <span class="key-term">Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI)</span> of each account held by the
                        firm in street name
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The Bank Secrecy Act <strong>forbids</strong> anyone who files a
                        Suspicious Activity Report from notifying any person involved in the suspected activity that an
                        SAR has been filed. This is sometimes called the "tipping off" prohibition. If the exam asks
                        whether a firm should inform a customer that an SAR was filed, the answer is always NO.

                <h4>Monetary Instrument Log (MIL)</h4>
                <p>
                    Broker-dealers must record cash purchases of negotiable instruments&mdash;personal checks, money
                    orders, travelers' checks&mdash;between <span class="key-term">$3,000 and $10,000</span> in an
                    internal log called a <span class="key-term">Monetary Instrument Log (MIL)</span>.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> MIL documents must be kept for 5 years. The exam likes to test the
                        various retention periods: MIL = 5 years, CIP records = 5 years, customer records = 6 years.

                <h4>Numbered Accounts</h4>
                <p>
                    Customers are permitted to open a <span class="key-term">numbered account</span>, using a number or
                    symbol instead of their name so they can remain anonymous when placing trades. But anonymity from
                    other traders doesn't mean anonymity from the firm&mdash;the customer's identity must still appear
                    on the new account form, and the owner must sign the form. This document is kept on file at the
                    broker-dealer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers may also open multiple individual accounts at a single broker-dealer, but they must sign a
                    statement affirming that the accounts are not held for any other individual.

                <h3>Topic 4: Trading Authorizations and Discretionary Accounts</h3>

                <h4>Account Ownership</h4>
                <p>
                    An individual account has only one owner. A representative may not give account information to
                    anyone else&mdash;including the account owner's spouse. The owner is the only person who can trade
                    in the account unless trading authorization has been explicitly granted.
                </p>

                <h4>Three Types of Trading Authorization</h4>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Limited trading authority</strong> &mdash; A third party can trade in the account,
                        but CANNOT make withdrawals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Full trading authority</strong> &mdash; A third party can trade AND make withdrawals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3. Discretionary authority</strong> &mdash; Gives the registered representative
                        authority to trade in the account on the customer's behalf.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>The AAA Rule: When You Don't Have Discretion</h4>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p>
                        Without discretionary authority, a representative needs
                        <strong>three pieces of information</strong> from the customer to execute any transaction.
                        Remember <strong>AAA</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>sset &mdash; the name of the security</li>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>ction &mdash; whether to buy or sell</li>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>mount &mdash; the quantity of the security to be traded</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If the customer provides all three, the representative does not need discretionary
                        authority&mdash;even if the customer leaves the timing and price to the rep's judgment.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In most cases, discretionary authority is NOT required to exercise
                    <span class="key-term">discretion over time and price</span>. This means the broker-dealer may wait
                    for the best time or price at which to execute a customer order, as long as it is executed on the
                    same day the customer places it.
                </p>

                <h4>Discretionary Accounts</h4>
                <p>
                    Discretionary authority must be given <strong>in writing</strong> before the account can be opened.
                    A discretionary account typically requires the customer to grant their representative a
                    <span class="key-term">power of attorney (POA)</span>. In most cases, the POA grants limited trading
                    authorization (to trade), not full authorization (to make withdrawals).
                </p>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Even with a power of attorney, a registered representative CANNOT
                        sign documents for a customer. The POA authorizes trading, not document execution. The exam
                        tests this regularly.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Churning in Discretionary Accounts</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Churning</span> is the entering of excessive, often unsuitable transactions
                    to generate commissions for the representative. It's a major concern in discretionary accounts
                    because the representative has the power to trade without asking permission each time.
                </p>
                <p>To guard against churning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A principal must <strong>approve all discretionary accounts</strong> before they are opened</li>
                    <li>A principal must <strong>promptly approve all discretionary orders</strong> in writing</li>
                    <li>A principal must <strong>review all discretionary accounts at frequent intervals</strong></li>
                </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Written notice to the executing firm</strong> &mdash; The associated person must
                            notify the firm where the account will be opened that they are an associated person of
                            another member firm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Written consent from the employer</strong> &mdash; The associated person must have
                            written consent from their employing firm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Duplicate confirmations and statements on request</strong> &mdash; The executing
                            firm must send duplicate trade confirmations and statements to the employer upon written
                            request.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The MSRB's version of this rule is slightly stricter: it requires
                        firms to send duplicate confirmations and statements <em>without</em> a written request. FINRA
                        only requires them upon request.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>This rule applies broadly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All employees of broker-dealers who open accounts at other member firms</li>
                    <li>
                        Employees who open accounts at non-member financial institutions such as banks, trust companies,
                        and investment advisers
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Related and Other Persons</h4>
                <p>The rule extends beyond just the employee. It also applies to accounts held by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The spouse of the associated person</li>
                    <li>
                        A child who lives in the same household or is financially dependent upon the associated person
                    </li>
                    <li>Any other related individual over whose account the associated person has control</li>
                    <li>Any other individual the associated person controls and provides financial support to</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All such accounts must be disclosed to the representative's employing broker-dealer.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Exception:</strong> The rule does not apply to accounts limited to investment company
                    securities or municipal fund securities (such as 529 plans).
                </p>

                <h4>Restrictions on FINRA Employees</h4>
                <p>FINRA has specific rules for its own employees who want brokerage accounts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Cannot have a debt or equity interest in broker-dealers, or companies with broker-dealer
                        subsidiaries that contribute 10% or more of the parent's revenue
                    </li>
                    <li>Cannot take options positions on these firms</li>
                    <li>Cannot purchase stock in an IPO</li>
                    <li>Must disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts they own or control</li>
                    <li>Must authorize their broker-dealer to send duplicate statements to FINRA</li>

                    One of the primary reasons for collecting all that new account information is to ensure that future
                    recommendations will be suitable for a particular customer. All regulators&mdash;FINRA, the MSRB,
                    and the SEC&mdash;have established suitability standards. And as with all regulations, the SEC has
                    the final say. <span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</span> is the ultimate
                    standard for client suitability.

                <h4>Suitability Information Collection</h4>
                <p>
                    FINRA requires firms to evaluate whether each recommendation is suitable for the customer. This
                    means collecting information on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer's age</li>
                    <li>Time horizon (length of investment time)</li>
                    <li>Liquidity needs</li>
                    <li>Risk tolerance</li>
                    <li>Tax status</li>
                    <li>Current and future financial needs</li>
                    <li>Investment experience</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A suitability questionnaire should be provided at account opening and kept in the customer's file.
                    Firms must make reasonable efforts to collect and maintain this information. The questionnaire
                    should be revisited and updated frequently&mdash;at least every <strong>36 months</strong>.

                        least <em>some</em> investors. Think of this as product-level due diligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. Customer-specific obligation</strong> &mdash; A broker-dealer must believe that a
                        recommendation is suitable for <em>this particular customer</em>, based on their personal and
                        investment profile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3. Quantitative suitability obligation</strong> &mdash; A broker-dealer must believe
                        that a series of recommended transactions is not excessive. Even if each trade is individually
                        suitable, the pattern as a whole must make sense.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    A suitability analysis must be conducted before a representative can make any recommendations.
                    However, a representative <strong>may accept unsolicited orders</strong> from a customer who has not
                    provided suitability information.
                </p>

                <h4>Institutional Customers Exception</h4>
                <p>
                    Broker-dealers are not subject to the same strict suitability rules for
                    <span class="key-term">institutional customers</span>. An institutional customer is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bank, savings and loan association, or insurance company</li>
                    <li>A registered investment company</li>
                    <li>A registered investment adviser</li>
                    <li>An individual with total assets of <strong>at least $50 million</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If the firm believes an institutional customer can evaluate risk independently, and the customer has
                    stated that it is acting independently, the broker-dealer has met its suitability requirements.
                </p>

                <h4>Municipal Securities Suitability (MSRB)</h4>
                <p>The MSRB suitability rule mirrors FINRA's and the SEC's, with a few additions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Firms must determine tax status by asking the customer for their
                        <strong>tax bracket</strong> and <strong>state of residence</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a customer refuses to disclose their financial status,
                        <strong>no recommendations can be made</strong> (but unsolicited trades can still be accepted)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the representative believes an unsolicited trade is unsuitable, the customer must be
                        informed. If the customer insists, the unsolicited order can then be entered
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Although not expressly prohibited, municipal securities are generally
                        NOT suitable for tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs. Why? Because munis already provide
                        tax-exempt income. Putting tax-exempt income inside a tax-deferred wrapper adds no
                        benefit&mdash;and you lose the tax exemption on withdrawal. The exam tests this frequently.

                <h3>Topic 2: Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</h3>

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        Before Reg BI was adopted in June 2019, broker-dealers were held only to a suitability
                        standard&mdash;meaning a recommendation just had to be "suitable" for the customer, even if a
                        better or cheaper alternative existed. Investment advisers, meanwhile, were held to a fiduciary
                        standard requiring them to act in their clients' best interest at all times. Reg BI was the
                        SEC's attempt to close that gap for broker-dealers without going all the way to a full fiduciary
                        duty.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The SEC's <span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</span> provides standards that
                    exceed traditional suitability requirements. Reg BI requires broker-dealers and their associated
                    persons to act in their <span class="key-term">retail customers' best interest</span>. The firm
                    cannot place its own financial interests ahead of its customers'. Firms must also identify,
                    eliminate, or disclose and mitigate any conflicts of interest between the firm and its retail
                    customers.
                </p>

                <h4>Retail Customer Definition</h4>
                <p>
                    A customer is considered a <span class="key-term">retail customer</span> under Reg BI if all of the
                    following are true:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The customer is a <strong>natural person</strong> (not a corporation) or a natural person's
                        legal representative (such as a trustee or executor)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The customer receives a recommendation from a broker-dealer about securities or an investment
                        strategy involving securities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The customer uses the recommendation primarily for <strong>personal investing</strong> (or that
                        of their family or household)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Accredited investors are NOT excluded from Reg BI protections. Even
                        wealthy, sophisticated investors are covered when receiving recommendations from broker-dealers.
                        Likewise, Reg BI applies to recommendations about private placements, OTC trades, and any other
                        securities transaction or strategy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>What Counts as a "Recommendation" Under Reg BI?</h4>
                <p>
                    Reg BI applies broadly to recommendations made across all account types&mdash;margin accounts,
                    retirement accounts, and education savings accounts.
                </p>
                <p>Recommendations covered include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What type of account to open (e.g., traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA)</li>
                    <li>Rollovers or transfers from one account to another</li>
                    <li>
                        Any <span class="key-term">call to action</span>&mdash;statements that suggest a specific course
                        of action
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>What is NOT a recommendation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simply discussing investment options</li>
                    <li>Providing general information (such as annual contribution limits for retirement accounts)</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Customers CANNOT waive Reg BI's protections under any circumstances.
                        If the exam asks whether a client can sign away their Reg BI rights, the answer is always no.
                    </p>

                <h4>The Four Obligations of Reg BI</h4>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p><strong>Reg BI imposes four obligations on broker-dealers:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Disclosure Obligation</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>The Care Obligation</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>The Conflict-of-Interest Obligation</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>The Compliance Obligation</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h4>1. The Disclosure Obligation</h4>
                <p>
                    Before or at the time of making a recommendation, firms must provide
                    <strong>full and fair written disclosure</strong> of the following material facts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>That the firm is acting in a <strong>broker-dealer capacity</strong></li>
                    <li>Material <strong>fees and costs</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Type and scope of services</strong> provided</li>
                    <li>
                        Any material <strong>limitations</strong> on the securities or strategies that may be
                        recommended
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All material facts relating to <strong>conflicts of interest</strong> associated with a
                        recommendation (e.g., proprietary products, third-party payments, compensation arrangements)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. The Care Obligation</h4>
                <p>
                    The SEC defines three components of the care obligation that closely mirror FINRA's suitability
                    framework:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reasonable-basis</strong>: The firm must understand the potential risks, rewards, and
                        costs associated with a recommendation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Customer-specific</strong>: The firm must consider risks, rewards, and costs in the
                        context of the customer's investment profile. Recommendations must be in the customer's best
                        interest and cannot prioritize the firm's interests. Reasonable alternatives should be
                        considered
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Quantitative</strong>: The firm cannot recommend a series of transactions that are
                        excessive&mdash;even if each transaction is individually sound. A representative may not
                        recommend multiple transactions simply to earn higher fees
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. The Conflict-of-Interest Obligation</h4>
                <p>Broker-dealers must establish, maintain, and enforce procedures to address conflicts of interest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify and mitigate</strong> conflicts that might create incentives to put the firm's
                        interests ahead of the customer's
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify and disclose</strong> material limitations on offerings (e.g., only offering
                        proprietary funds) and prevent those limitations from disadvantaging customers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify and eliminate</strong> sales contests, sales quotas, bonuses, and noncash
                        compensation based on the sale of <strong>specific securities</strong> (e.g., a sales contest
                        for mutual funds from a particular company)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">The Contest Distinction</div>
                    <p>
                        A sales contest rewarding the top seller of "ABC Fund Company mutual funds" must be
                        eliminated&mdash;it creates an incentive to push a specific product. But a contest rewarding the
                        top seller of "all mutual funds" across all sponsors is permissible, because it's based on a
                        general category, not a specific security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, some hiring bonuses take the form of forgivable loans that must be repaid if a new
                        hire fails to meet performance goals. Whether such a loan is forgiven CANNOT depend on sales of
                        specific securities or specific types of securities.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>4. The Compliance Obligation</h4>
                <p>
                    Reg BI requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce
                    <strong>written policies and procedures</strong> designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind the key distinction: these standards apply to broker-dealers.
                    <span class="key-term">Registered investment advisers</span> are already held to a
                    <span class="key-term">fiduciary standard</span> that requires them to always act in their
                    customers' best interest.
                </p>

                <h4>Form CRS (Customer Relationship Summary)</h4>
                <p>
                    Broker-dealers and investment advisers must deliver a summary of their relationship with a customer
                    via <span class="key-term">Form CRS</span>, the Customer Relationship Summary.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h4>Trade Confirmations</h4>
                <p>
                    Customers must be sent written confirmation of each transaction
                    <strong>at or before settlement</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4>Errors in Confirmations</h4>
                <p>If a confirmation contains errors, the firm must send a corrected confirmation.</p>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> If the price on a confirmation is wrong, the customer pays the actual
                        execution price&mdash;not the price on the confirmation. If the confirmation says $20/share but
                        the trade executed at $21, the customer owes $21. The confirmation doesn't change reality.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Errors in Execution</h4>
                <p>If a trade was incorrectly executed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The original trade is canceled and rebilled at the correct amount</li>
                    <li>
                        The customer receives <strong>two new confirmations</strong>: one canceling the erroneous trade,
                        one documenting the correction
                    </li>
                    <li>The customer pays the actual execution price</li>
                    <li>All trade cancellations or adjustments must be <strong>approved by a principal</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Errors in Client Instructions</h4>
                <p>
                    If the client gave incorrect instructions, the client is obligated to accept the trade. For example,
                    if a customer wanted to buy 1,000 shares of ABA at market but told the firm to buy 1,000 shares of
                    AAB at market, the customer must pay for the AAB shares. You said it, you own it.
                </p>

                <h4>Delivery Instructions</h4>
                <p>
                    Most securities today are issued in <span class="key-term">book-entry form</span>&mdash;an
                    electronic record on the books of the broker-dealer or issuer. But some physical certificates still
                    exist. When physical securities are involved, customers have four options:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Transfer and Ship</strong> &mdash; Securities are delivered to the customer's address of
                    record.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Transfer and Hold</strong> &mdash; Securities are registered in the customer's name but held
                    for safekeeping by the brokerage firm. The firm may charge a fee for this service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Hold in Street Name</strong> &mdash; Securities are held in book-entry form and registered
                    in the name of the brokerage firm. The broker-dealer is the
                    <span class="key-term">owner of record</span>; the investor is the
                    <span class="key-term">beneficial owner</span>, retaining all rights of ownership (dividends, voting
                    rights) without being listed directly on the issuer's books.
                </p>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Securities are generally held in street name unless the investor
                        specifically requests otherwise. And ALL securities in a margin account MUST be held in street
                        name&mdash;no exceptions.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Direct Registration</strong> &mdash; Securities are registered in the purchaser's own name
                    without a physical certificate. The customer receives statements, dividends, annual reports,
                    proxies, and other mailings directly from the issuer, bypassing the broker entirely.
                </p>

                <h4>Cash and Mailing Instructions</h4>
                <p>Customers must instruct their broker-dealer on how to handle income and sales proceeds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interest payments and dividends may be delivered in cash or reinvested</li>
                    <li>
                        Sale proceeds may be delivered directly to the customer, placed in a money market account, or
                        credited to the investor's cash balance until reinvested
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Quarterly Statements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Customers must receive <strong>quarterly statements</strong> showing all positions at their
                        current market value
                    </li>
                    <li>No statement is required for a quarter with no balance or securities</li>
                    <li>
                        If the customer owns <span class="key-term">penny stocks</span>, statements must be sent
                        <strong>monthly</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>Statements can be mailed or sent electronically at the customer's request</li>
                    <li>
                        Firms may charge for paper statements and confirmations, which is why many clients opt for
                        electronic delivery
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A legend on account statements must direct customers to promptly report inaccuracies or
                        discrepancies
                    </li>
                    <li>The phone number provided for reporting cannot be the representative's personal number</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Holding Customer Mail</h4>
                <p>
                    Customer mail must be sent to the address on the new account form or to a post office box designated
                    by the customer. It <strong>cannot</strong> be directed to the registered representative's office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers may request in writing that mail be sent to an investment adviser or any individual with
                    power of attorney.
                </p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Mail Hold Rules</div>
                    <p><strong>Up to 3 months within a 12-month period:</strong> Customer must request in writing.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Longer than 3 months:</strong> Written request must include an acceptable reason (e.g.,
                        safety or security concerns).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>NOT an acceptable reason:</strong> Convenience. FINRA has explicitly stated that
                        convenience does not justify holding mail beyond 3 months.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Accounts Are the Property of the Firm</h4>
                <p>
                    If a registered representative leaves a broker-dealer for any reason, all accounts are considered
                    the <strong>property of the firm</strong>. The broker-dealer will allocate the departing
                    representative's accounts among existing representatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a representative inherits an account from a retiring or departing representative, the account
                    documents must be updated <strong>before making any transactions</strong> in the account.
                </p>

                <h4>Proxy Materials</h4>
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The term "street name" comes from Wall Street itself. Because so many broker-dealers were
                        historically located on or near Wall Street, securities registered in the firm's name became
                        known as being held "in the name of the street." The convention persists even though
                        broker-dealers are now scattered across the country.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When securities are held in <span class="key-term">street name</span>, the firm&mdash;not the
                    investor&mdash;is listed as the owner on the issuer's books. But the investor remains the
                    <span class="key-term">beneficial owner</span>, retaining all rights of ownership including
                    dividends and voting rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A firm holding securities in street name must forward all issuer communications&mdash;annual
                    reports, proxy statements, and other materials&mdash;to the beneficial owner or their investment
                    adviser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SEC requires companies to send a <span class="key-term">proxy statement</span> before every
                    stockholders' meeting. Whenever an issuer delivers proxy materials to a firm and promises to
                    reimburse out-of-pocket expenses, the member firm must promptly forward those materials to the
                    beneficial owner.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Proxy statements provide information on upcoming votes, including:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Election of individuals to the board of directors</li>
                    <li>Election or ratification of the company's accountant</li>
                    <li>Authorization of new securities issues</li>
                    <li>Modification or exchange of securities</li>
                    <li>Any other submitted shareholder resolutions</li>

                <h3>Topic 4: Senior Citizen Accounts</h3>

                <h4>Senior Citizen Suitability</h4>
                <p>
                    FINRA has stated that a customer's age and life stage are both important factors in determining
                    suitability. As investors age, their investment time horizons, goals, risk tolerance, and tax status
                    often change&mdash;and liquidity takes on added importance.
                </p>

                <h4>Typically Unsuitable Recommendations for Seniors</h4>
                <p>
                    FINRA does not prohibit any particular recommendation to a senior citizen if it's genuinely
                    suitable. However, certain types of recommendations raise red flags:
                </p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Red Flags for Senior Accounts</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Purchase of variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities, or real estate limited
                            partnerships
                        </li>
                        <li>Purchase of variable life settlements</li>
                        <li>Purchase of complex structured products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)</li>
                        <li>
                            A recommendation to <strong>mortgage their residence</strong> to obtain investment funds
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A recommendation to use <strong>retirement savings</strong>, including early IRA
                            withdrawals, to invest in high-risk investments
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Senior Certifications</h4>
                <p>
                    FINRA is concerned about representatives using bogus certifications to appear more credible when
                    working with senior citizens.

                <h4>Trusted Contact Person</h4>
                <p>
                    FINRA requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name and contact information of a
                    <span class="key-term">trusted contact person</span> when opening an account. The member must
                    disclose in writing that the firm may contact the trusted contact person to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Disclose information about the client's account to address possible
                        <strong>financial exploitation</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Confirm the specifics of the client's current
                        <strong>contact information or health status</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Obtain the identity of any
                        <strong>legal guardian, executor, trustee, or holder of a power of attorney</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Diminished Mental Capacity</h4>
                <p>
                    Firms must train employees to identify <span class="key-term">diminished mental capacity</span>.
                    FINRA requires an internal process that allows representatives to seek guidance from others on what
                    steps to take.

                <h4>Financial Exploitation of Specified Adults</h4>
                <p>
                    FINRA allows firms to place <span class="key-term">temporary holds on disbursements</span> from
                    client accounts when fraud is suspected. The investors FINRA considers particularly susceptible to
                    financial exploitation are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals <strong>aged 65 or older</strong></li>
                    <li>
                        Individuals <strong>aged 18 or older</strong> with a mental or physical impairment that makes
                        them unable to protect their interests
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>FINRA refers to these individuals as <span class="key-term">specified adults</span>.</p>

                <h4>The Hold Timeline</h4>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p><strong>Temporary hold on suspicious disbursements:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial hold:</strong> 15 business days</li>
                        <li><strong>Extension if exploitation is confirmed:</strong> Additional 10 business days</li>
                        <li><strong>If state or federal investigation:</strong> Additional 30 days</li>

                    <p>
                        The hold applies ONLY to suspicious disbursements, not to all account activity. Non-suspicious

                <h3>Topic 5: Transferring and Closing Accounts</h3>

                <h4>Internal Transfers</h4>
                <p>
                    If a customer wants their account transferred to another broker at the <strong>same firm</strong>,
                    the branch manager must approve the transfer. No new account form is required.
                </p>

                <h4>External Account Transfers (ACATS)</h4>
                <p>
                    When a customer wants to transfer to a <strong>different firm</strong>, the process begins with a
                    <span class="key-term">Transfer Initiation Form (TIF)</span>, provided by the firm that will receive
                    the assets&mdash;the <span class="key-term">receiving firm</span>.
                </p>

                    <p><strong>ACATS Transfer Timeline:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Customer fills out TIF with the <strong>receiving firm</strong></li>
                        <li>
                            Receiving firm immediately sends a request-to-transfer to the
                            <strong>carrying firm</strong> (also called the <strong>delivering firm</strong>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Carrying firm enters the request into the
                            <strong>Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS)</strong>, operated by the NSCC
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Carrying firm has <strong>1 business day</strong> to validate or take exception to the
                            transfer
                        </li>
                        <li>If validated, carrying firm sends a list of assets to the receiving firm via ACATS</li>
                        <li>
                            Carrying firm <strong>freezes the account</strong>, cancels all open orders (except options
                            expiring within 7 days), and stops accepting new orders
                        </li>
                        <li>Receiving firm reviews the asset list and decides whether to accept</li>
                        <li>
                            If accepted, the delivering firm has <strong>3 additional business days</strong> to complete
                            the transfer
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The transfer request must include the customer's name, Social Security number, and account
                        number.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Reasons a Carrying Firm May Reject a Transfer</h4>
                <p>
                    The carrying firm isn't required to accept every transfer request. Common reasons for taking
                    exception include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The account contains no transferable assets</li>
                    <li>Transfer instructions are incorrect</li>
                    <li>The transfer would violate the firm's credit policy</li>
                    <li>The receiving firm cannot identify the customer as the record owner of the assets</li>
                    <li>The Social Security or tax ID number or account title doesn't match</li>
                    <li>Authorization for the transfer is missing or incomplete</li>
                    <li>The customer has already taken possession of the assets (or they're in transit)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    However, FINRA prohibits broker-dealers from interfering with a customer's account transfer simply
                    because they don't want to lose the client.
                </p>

                <h4>Educational Brochure When Soliciting Account Transfers</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">FINRA Rule 2273</span> addresses situations where a representative moves to a
                    new firm and solicits former customers to follow them.
                </p>
                <p>If such a solicitation is made, an <strong>educational brochure</strong> must be provided:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With any <strong>written solicitation</strong>, or</li>
                    <li>Within <strong>3 business days</strong> if the solicitation is oral</li>
                </ul>

                    <div class="info-box__title">Educational Brochure Contents</div>

                        <li>
                            The representative may receive <strong>incentives from the new firm</strong> that create a
                            conflict of interest
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some assets may <strong>not be transferable</strong>&mdash;they would need to be liquidated
                            and the cash transferred, or if assets remain at the old firm, they may face higher
                            maintenance fees
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fee structures</strong> can differ between firms; the new firm might charge more
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Products and services</strong> available at each firm can differ</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The brochure must be delivered within a <strong>3-month window</strong> following the
                    representative's association with the new firm. The rule also applies if a former customer seeks to
                    transfer assets without being individually contacted&mdash;in that case, the customer must receive
                    the brochure with the approved account transfer documentation.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        All powers of attorney and third-party authorizations, including discretionary authority, are

                <p>
                    The executor of the customer's estate will typically transfer assets to an estate account. No
                    changes can be made until proper legal documents are provided:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Letters testamentary</strong> (court-issued documents verifying the executor's identity)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance tax waivers</strong> (required in some states)</li>
                    <li>A <strong>certified copy of the death certificate</strong></li>
                    <li>An <strong>affidavit of domicile</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Estate Accounts</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Estate accounts</span> are a type of trust whose purpose is to safeguard a
                    deceased person's assets pending probate. A designated executor creates this temporary account to
                    hold assets while settling the estate.
                </p>
                <p>To open an estate account, the executor needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>taxpayer ID number</strong> in the estate's name (obtained from the IRS)</li>
                    <li>A copy of the deceased's <strong>death certificate</strong></li>
                    <li>A list of <strong>bank accounts</strong> held by the deceased</li>
                    <li>Proof of the executor's <strong>legal status</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The firm may also be asked to value the securities in the account&mdash;the market value of all
                    securities should be determined as of the <strong>date of death</strong>.
                </p>
                <p><strong>How different account types handle death:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a <span class="key-term">joint tenants in common (JTIC or TIC)</span> account, the executor
                        legally transfers the deceased's proportional share of assets into the estate account
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a <span class="key-term">joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS)</span> account,
                        the assets transfer to the surviving owner(s) <strong>without going through probate</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upon the death of a child, assets in a
                        <span class="key-term">Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)</span> account are NOT transferred to
                        the parents&mdash;they become part of the child's estate
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Transfer on Death (TOD) Accounts</h4>
                <p>
                    Most states allow account holders to name a beneficiary to inherit securities without going through
                    probate court. Customers register the securities with the broker using a
                    <span class="key-term">transfer on death (TOD)</span> designation form, naming one or more
                    individuals to receive the securities upon their death.
                </p>
                <p>TOD beneficiaries typically need only:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>certified copy of the death certificate</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Proof of identity</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Although TOD accounts avoid probate, the assets are still subject to
                        estate taxes. "Avoiding probate" and "avoiding taxes" are two very different things&mdash;the

                    Every recommendation you'll ever make, every trade you'll ever execute, and every dispute you'll
                    ever face traces back to how the account was opened. The new account form isn't just
                    paperwork&mdash;it's the legal foundation that determines what's suitable, what's authorized, and
                    who's responsible when things go wrong.
