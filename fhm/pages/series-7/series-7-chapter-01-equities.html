        <div class="intro">
            <p>
                On May 17, 1792, twenty-four stockbrokers gathered under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street
                and signed an agreement to trade securities only among themselves and charge minimum commissions.
                That moment—the Buttonwood Agreement—created what would become the New York Stock Exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the global equity market holds over $100 trillion in value. Understanding how stocks
                work isn't just academic—it's the foundation of everything else on your Series 7 exam.

            <h2>Section 1: Common Stock Basics</h2>

            <h3>Why This Section Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Companies need money to operate. They can borrow it (debt financing) or sell ownership stakes
                (equity financing). When you buy stock, you're buying a piece of a company—literally. This
                section covers the mechanics of how that ownership works: what shares are, how they're tracked,
                and what happens when they change hands.
            </p>

            <h3>Common Stock Is Equity</h3>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>
                    The word "stock" comes from the old English word for a tree trunk—the solid base from
                    which everything else grows. A "share" of stock meant you shared in that growth. The
                    terminology has survived for centuries because the concept is simple: you own a piece
                    of something.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">common stockholder</span> (or shareholder) owns a piece of a corporation.
                This ownership represents <span class="key-term">equity</span> in the company. Beyond corporations,
                investment companies like mutual funds also issue common stock. Common stockholders hope to share
                in the company's growth through increases in the share price.
            </p>

            <h4>Authorized Stock and Par Value</h4>
            <p>
                When a corporation is formed, its <span class="key-term">corporate charter</span> specifies the
                maximum number of common shares the company may issue. This ceiling is called
                <span class="key-term">authorized stock</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each share is assigned an arbitrary <span class="key-term">par value</span>—perhaps $1 or even
                $0.01 per share. Here's what trips up many test-takers: par value for common stock has absolutely
                no bearing on market price. It's purely an accounting artifact. Market value is based on investor
                expectations about the company's future.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Don't confuse par value for common stock with par value for
                    bonds or preferred stock. For common stock, par is meaningless for pricing. For bonds
                    and preferred, par matters enormously.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Issued Stock</h4>
            <p>
                To raise capital, a corporation will <span class="key-term">issue</span> (sell) stock to the public.
                Here's the strategic reality: most companies don't issue all their authorized shares at once.
                They hold some back. Why? Because issuing more shares later—without amending the corporate
                charter—is much easier than going back to shareholders for permission to increase authorized shares.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
                <p>
                    A corporation is authorized to sell 1,000,000 common shares. It issues only 400,000 shares
                    initially, keeping 600,000 in reserve:
                </p>
                <div class="comparison-table">
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Issued Shares</th>
                            <th>Unissued Shares</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>400,000</td>
                            <td>600,000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td colspan="2" style="text-align: center; font-weight: 600; background: var(--fh-gray-100);">Total Authorized: 1,000,000 Shares</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h4>Outstanding Shares</h4>
            <p>
                Once issued, shares are said to be <span class="key-term">outstanding</span>. These outstanding
                shares can be freely traded between investors. The number of outstanding shares times the current
                market price gives you the company's <span class="key-term">market capitalization</span> (market cap).
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Market Cap = Outstanding Shares × Market Price per Share</div>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
                <p>
                    If a company has 400,000 shares outstanding at $10 per share, its market cap is $4 million.
                    This is how investors quickly compare company sizes: Apple's market cap exceeds $3 trillion,
                    while a small-cap company might have a market cap under $2 billion.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Treasury Stock</h4>
            <p>
                After issuing stock, a corporation may choose to <span class="key-term">buy back</span> some shares.
                Repurchased shares are called <span class="key-term">treasury stock</span> (or treasury shares).
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Why Companies Buy Back Stock</div>
                <p>
                    Stock buybacks became popular in the 1980s when the SEC provided a safe harbor from manipulation
                    charges. Today, companies buy back stock for several strategic reasons: to boost earnings per
                    share (fewer shares means earnings are divided among fewer pieces), to signal that management
                    believes shares are undervalued, to fund employee stock purchase plans, or simply because they
                    have excess cash and no better investment ideas.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Memorize This: Treasury Stock Limitations</div>
                <p>Treasury shares are different from outstanding shares in two critical ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Treasury shares cannot vote</strong> — Only outstanding shares vote</li>
                    <li><strong>Treasury shares do not receive dividends</strong> — Dividends go only to outstanding shares</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                (Whether those buyback decisions consistently add value for shareholders is a debate that has
                launched a thousand academic papers and at least one congressional hearing.)
            </p>

            <h4>Transfer Agents and Registrars</h4>
            <p>Corporations hire specialized firms to maintain ownership records:</p>

            <div class="comparison-table">
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Role</th>
                        <th>Function</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Transfer Agent</strong></td>
                        <td>Records ownership changes, cancels and issues certificates, maintains shareholder list</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Registrar</strong></td>
                        <td>Audits the transfer agent, verifies shareholder information</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Paying Agent</strong></td>
                        <td>Handles distributions like dividends (often the same firm)</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <h4>Regular Way Settlement</h4>
            <p>
                Equity securities trade on exchanges (<span class="key-term">listed</span>) or
                <span class="key-term">over-the-counter</span> (unlisted). Listed securities meet stringent
                requirements set by exchanges like the <span class="key-term">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</span>
                or <span class="key-term">Nasdaq</span>. OTC securities are typically smaller companies that
                don't meet listing standards.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Why Settlement Matters</div>
                <p>
                    When you buy a stock, you immediately become the economic owner—if the price drops five
                    minutes later, that's your loss. But you're not the official owner of record until the
                    trade settles. The distinction matters because dividends, votes, and other rights go to
                    the owner of record, not necessarily the economic owner.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Settlement</span> occurs when securities and money officially change hands.

        <section id="section-2">
            <h2>Section 2: Distributions</h2>

            <p>
                In 1626, the Dutch West India Company paid the first dividend in what would become America—a
                return to shareholders from the profits of the fur trade. Nearly four centuries later, dividends
                remain one of the fundamental ways corporations share profits with their owners.
            </p>

            <h3>Why This Section Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Investors buy stock for two reasons: growth (the price goes up) and income (they receive cash
                along the way). Understanding how corporations distribute value to shareholders—through cash
                dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and rights offerings—is essential for advising clients
                and passing your exam.
            </p>

            <h3>Cash Dividends</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Cash dividends</span> allow a company to share profits with shareholders.
                The <span class="key-term">board of directors</span> declares dividends, typically paid quarterly
                to shareholders of record.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Why Some Companies Don't Pay Dividends</div>
                <p>
                    Young, growing companies often reinvest all their profits back into the business rather than
                    paying dividends. The logic: if the company can earn 20% returns by expanding, why give that
                    money to shareholders who might only earn 5% in a savings account? This is why many tech
                    companies pay no dividends. Mature companies like utilities typically pay higher dividends
                    because their growth opportunities are limited.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Stock Dividends</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Stock dividends</span> give additional shares to existing stockholders
                instead of cash. When a company issues stock dividends, the total number of shares outstanding
                increases, but the value of each share decreases proportionally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's the key insight: there's no immediate economic value to shareholders who receive a stock
                dividend. The company's total value hasn't changed—it's just been sliced into more pieces.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Stock dividends are defined as distributions of less than 25% of
                    outstanding shares. Anything 25% or larger is classified as a stock split, not a dividend.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Stock Splits</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Stock splits</span> increase (<span class="key-term">forward split</span>)
                or decrease (<span class="key-term">reverse split</span>) the number of shares outstanding using a ratio.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Forward Split Example (2:1)</div>
                <p>An investor owns 100 shares at $50 each = $5,000 total value.</p>
                <p>After a 2:1 split: 200 shares at $25 each = $5,000 total value.</p>
                <p><em>Same pizza, twice as many slices.</em></p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>Why would a company split its stock?</strong> A lower share price makes shares more
                accessible to small investors. A 10:1 split brings a $1,000 stock to $100—psychologically
                more accessible.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Reverse Split Example (1:10)</div>
                <p>An investor owns 1,000 shares at $0.50 each = $500 total value.</p>
                <p>After a 1:10 reverse split: 100 shares at $5.00 each = $500 total value.</p>
                <p><em>Companies do this to meet minimum exchange price requirements or to appear more
                "respectable" to institutional investors who avoid penny stocks.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Par Value Adjusts with Splits</div>
                <p>
                    When a company executes a stock split, the par value per share adjusts proportionally,
                    but total par value stays the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> ABC has 1 million shares at $1.00 par = $1 million total par value.
                    After a 2:1 split: 2 million shares at $0.50 par = $1 million total par value.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Uneven Stock Splits</h4>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Uneven Split Example (5:4)</div>
                <p><strong>Before:</strong> 300 shares at $30 = $9,000</p>
                <p><strong>Step 1 (Shares):</strong> 300 × (5/4) = 375 shares</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2 (Price):</strong> $30 × (4/5) = $24 per share</p>
                <p><strong>After:</strong> 375 shares at $24 = $9,000</p>
                <p><em>Note: For price, use the inverse of the split ratio.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Neither stock dividends nor stock splits are taxable when received.
                    They result in a cost basis adjustment, not a taxable event. Cash dividends, however, are
                    taxable upon receipt.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Preemptive Rights</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Preemptive rights</span> protect shareholders from having their ownership
                diluted when a company issues new shares.
            </p>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Why Preemptive Rights Exist</div>
                <p>
                    Imagine owning 10% of a company. The board decides to issue shares only to their friends
                    at a bargain price. Suddenly your 10% becomes 1%. Preemptive rights ensure existing
                    shareholders get first crack at new shares to maintain their proportional ownership.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Companies fulfill preemptive rights by issuing <span class="key-term">rights</span>
                (also called <span class="key-term">subscription rights</span>). Rights are short-term securities
                (typically 30-60 days) that give shareholders the option to buy new shares at a discount.
            </p>

            <p><strong>A shareholder receiving rights has three choices:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Exercise</strong> — Buy new shares at the discounted price</li>
                <li><strong>Sell</strong> — Transfer the rights to another investor</li>
                <li><strong>Do nothing</strong> — Let the rights expire worthless</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                In 1602, the Dutch East India Company became the first corporation to issue stock to the general
                public. The concept was revolutionary: ordinary people could own a piece of a massive trading
                enterprise. But ownership without rights is meaningless.

                One crucial protection: shareholders enjoy <span class="key-term">limited liability</span>.
                Their losses are capped at their investment. If a company goes bankrupt owing billions,
                creditors can't come after shareholders' personal assets.

                <p>
                    Shareholders must approve actions that could dilute their ownership or fundamentally
                    change the company. They don't need to approve things that benefit them directly.
                    Treasury stock buybacks don't require approval because they benefit remaining shareholders.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Voting Methods</h4>

            <p><strong>Statutory Voting</strong> (most common): Votes must be evenly distributed.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Statutory Voting Example</div>
                <p>
                    Three board seats open. Shareholder with 100 shares has 300 total votes (100 × 3).
                    They can cast exactly 100 votes for each candidate—no more, no less.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Cumulative Voting</strong>: Shareholders can allocate votes however they choose.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Cumulative Voting Example</div>
                <p>
                    Same scenario: 100 shares, three seats, 300 total votes. The shareholder could cast
                    all 300 votes for one candidate, or split them any way totaling 300.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Cumulative voting benefits small investors because they can
                    concentrate their votes to help elect at least one director who represents their interests.
                </p>

            <p>
                Most shareholders don't attend annual meetings. Companies send <span class="key-term">proxies</span>—ballots
                that grant <span class="key-term">power of attorney</span> to cast votes on the shareholder's behalf.
            </p>

            <h4>Nonvoting Stock</h4>
            <p>
                Some companies issue common stock with no voting rights. These shares receive dividends and have
                the same residual claims—they just can't vote. This lets companies raise capital while founders
                maintain voting control.
            </p>

            <p>
                (Silicon Valley loves this arrangement, which explains why many tech founders control their
                companies long after their economic ownership has been diluted to single digits.)

            <h2>Section 4: Preferred Stock</h2>

            <p>
                In 1836, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad issued the first American preferred stock to finance
                westward expansion. The railroad needed capital but didn't want to dilute voting power. The
                solution: a new class of stock with better dividend treatment but no vote.
            </p>

            <h3>Preferred Stock Basic Features</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Preferred stock</span> is called "preferred" because it gets preferred
                treatment over common stock in two key situations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dividends</strong>: Preferred shareholders receive full year's dividends before common shareholders get anything</li>
                <li><strong>Liquidation</strong>: If company dissolves, preferred paid before common shareholders</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Preferred stock is typically issued at <span class="key-term">$100 par</span> with a stated
                <span class="key-term">dividend rate</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Preferred Dividend Calculation</div>
                <p>A company issues $100 par 10% preferred stock.</p>
                <p>Annual dividend = 10% × $100 = $10 per share per year</p>
                <p>Dividends typically paid quarterly ($2.50 per quarter). This rate is fixed regardless of market price.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Unlike common stock, preferred stockholders cannot vote and have no preemptive rights—the
                trade-off for their preferential treatment.

            <h3>Types of Preferred Stock</h3>

            <h4>Cumulative Preferred</h4>
            <p>
                If the issuer skips dividend payments on <span class="key-term">cumulative preferred</span>,
                missed payments accumulate. All must be paid before common shareholders receive any dividend.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Cumulative Dividend Example</div>
                <p>Company has $100 par 8% cumulative preferred. Misses dividends for 2 years, then wants to pay common dividend in year 3.</p>
                <p>Must pay first: Year 1 ($8) + Year 2 ($8) + Year 3 ($8) = <strong>$24 per share</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h4>Adjustable-Rate Preferred</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Adjustable-rate preferred</span> pays dividends tied to a benchmark
                rate (like Treasury bills). Income fluctuates, but share price remains relatively stable,
                providing <span class="key-term">preservation of capital</span>.
            </p>

            <h4>Callable Preferred</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Callable preferred</span> can be redeemed by the issuer after a set date.
                Companies call when interest rates fall—retire old higher-rate shares, issue new at lower rates.
                Callable preferred pays higher dividends to compensate for call risk.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Common stock is never callable. Only preferred stock and bonds can be called.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Convertible Preferred</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Convertible preferred</span> can be exchanged for common stock at a
                predetermined conversion ratio. If common stock rises significantly, convertible preferred rises with it.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The price of convertible preferred is primarily driven by the
                    underlying common stock, not by interest rates like regular preferred.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Participating Preferred</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Participating preferred</span> receives fixed dividend plus potentially
                additional dividends when declared. Allows participation in company profits during strong earnings years.
            </p>

            <h3>Interest Rate Movements and Preferred Stock Prices</h3>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">The Iron Law of Fixed-Income Securities</div>
                <p>There is an <strong>inverse relationship</strong> between interest rates and preferred stock prices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When interest rates <strong>RISE</strong>, preferred stock prices <strong>FALL</strong></li>
                    <li>When interest rates <strong>FALL</strong>, preferred stock prices <strong>RISE</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The logic: if new preferred offers 8% and you hold preferred paying 6%, your shares must
                    fall in price to offer buyers a competitive yield.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Current Yield Calculation</h4>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Current Yield = Annual Income ÷ Market Price</div>

                <div class="info-box__title">Current Yield Example</div>
                <p>10% preferred stock ($100 par) trades at $90 per share.</p>
                <p>Annual dividend = $10 ($100 × 10%)</p>
                <p>Current Yield = $10 ÷ $90 = <strong>11.1%</strong></p>
                <p>Current yield exceeds stated rate because investor bought at a discount.</p>

            <h2>Section 5: Special Securities</h2>

            <p>
                Beyond common stock, preferred stock, and rights, two other equity-related securities
                appear frequently on the Series 7 exam: warrants and American Depositary Receipts.
            </p>

            <h3>Warrants</h3>
            <p>
                In 1911, AT&T issued the first publicly traded warrants to make a bond offering more attractive.
                A <span class="key-term">warrant</span> gives the holder the right to buy stock at a fixed
                price—typically set well above current market price. Warrants only become valuable if the
                stock price rises above the exercise price.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Warrant Example</div>
                <p>
                    Company issues bond with one warrant attached. Stock trades at $20. Warrant allows
                    purchase at $30, expiring in 5 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At issuance, no immediate value—why pay $30 when shares cost $20? But if stock rises
                    to $50 within 5 years, that warrant lets you buy at $30 for instant $20 profit.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="comparison-table">

                </table>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Warrants, rights, and convertible securities are not considered
                    equity until exercised or converted. Until then, they're derivative securities.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)</h3>

            <p>
                Foreign companies wanting U.S. investors face a challenge: listing directly on U.S. exchanges
                is expensive. <span class="key-term">American Depositary Receipts</span> offer a workaround.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How ADRs Work:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>U.S. bank purchases foreign stock, holds it in trust in country of origin</li>
                <li>Bank issues ADRs representing those shares</li>
                <li>ADRs registered with SEC, trade in U.S. markets, priced in U.S. dollars</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                ADR holders receive dividends (converted to dollars) but don't have voting or preemptive rights—the
                bank handles those.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Currency Risk in ADRs</div>
                <p>
                    Although priced in dollars, ADR value depends partly on exchange rates.
                    This <span class="key-term">exchange rate risk</span> (currency risk) means:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foreign currency <strong>weakens</strong> → ADR value <strong>falls</strong></li>
                    <li>Foreign currency <strong>strengthens</strong> → ADR value <strong>rises</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>ADR investors face two risks: company performance AND currency fluctuations.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                (Currency risk is why many U.S. investors wake up to find their international holdings moved
                2% overnight while they slept—the company did nothing, but the yen did.)
