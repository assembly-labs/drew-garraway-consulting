        <div class="intro">
            <p>
                In 1934, a pair of Columbia Business School professors published a 725-page book called
                <em>Security Analysis</em>. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd argued that stocks had an intrinsic
                value that could be calculated by examining a company's financial statements—and that the
                market's mood swings created opportunities for disciplined investors who did their homework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the same time, Charles Dow—founder of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and
                <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>—had already pioneered the idea that stock price patterns
                themselves contained useful information. His followers believed you didn't need to read a
                balance sheet if you could read a chart.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two camps—fundamental analysis and technical analysis—have been arguing ever since.
                The Series 7 expects you to understand both, plus a third approach: portfolio analysis,
                which focuses not on picking individual securities but on building the right combination of them.

            <h2>Topic 1: Technical Analysis</h2>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>
                    Charles Dow never actually called his ideas "technical analysis." He wrote a series of
                    editorials in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> between 1900 and 1902 observing that stock
                    prices moved in identifiable trends. After his death, followers compiled his observations
                    into what became known as "Dow Theory"—the grandfather of every chart pattern, moving
                    average, and trend line used today.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Technical analysis</span> focuses on price trends to gauge where the
                market or an individual security may be heading. Technical analysts—sometimes called
                "chartists"—believe that all relevant information is already reflected in the price, so
                studying price movements is the most efficient way to make investment decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core assumption: history tends to repeat itself. If a stock has bounced off a certain
                price three times before, it might do so again.
            </p>

            <h3>The Trend Line</h3>
            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">trend line</span> is the most basic tool in technical analysis.
                It connects a series of prices over time to reveal the direction of movement.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An <span class="key-term">uptrend</span> shows prices making higher highs and higher lows—the line slopes up from left to right</li>
                <li>A <span class="key-term">downtrend</span> shows prices making lower highs and lower lows—the line slopes down</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The simplest question a technical analyst asks: "Is the trend your friend?" If a security
                is in an established uptrend, technicians expect it to continue until something breaks the pattern.
            </p>

            <h3>Seasons (Cyclical Patterns)</h3>
            <p>
                Patterns of up-and-down price movements that follow a repeating cycle are known as
                <span class="key-term">seasons</span> or <span class="key-term">seasonal trends</span>.
                Two classic chart shapes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saucer</strong> — a U-shaped pattern where prices gradually decline, bottom out, and then gradually rise. Bullish reversal.</li>
                <li><strong>Inverted Saucer</strong> — an upside-down U where prices rise, top out, and then decline. Bearish reversal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Support, Resistance, and Breakouts</h3>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Resistance</strong> = the ceiling (price struggles to go higher)<br>
                    <strong>Support</strong> = the floor (price struggles to go lower)<br>
                    A <strong>breakout</strong> occurs when price pushes through either level.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">resistance level</span> is a price point where a security repeatedly
                fails to move higher. Think of it as a ceiling that the price keeps bumping against. Sellers
                tend to emerge at this level, pushing the price back down.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">support level</span> is the opposite—a price floor where buyers
                consistently step in, preventing the price from falling further.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the price finally pushes through resistance, that's a <span class="key-term">breakout</span>—generally
                considered bullish because the old ceiling has been overcome. If the price breaks below support,
                the signal is bearish.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Once resistance is broken, it often becomes the new support
                    level (and vice versa). This concept of "role reversal" shows up on exam questions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Consolidating Market</h3>
            <p>
                A market that moves within a narrow range—bouncing between support and resistance without
                making significant new highs or lows—is said to be <span class="key-term">consolidating</span>.
                Also called <span class="key-term">sideways movement</span>. Consolidation often precedes a
                significant move in one direction.
            </p>

            <h3>Head and Shoulders</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">head and shoulders</span> pattern is one of the most recognized
                reversal patterns in technical analysis. It signals a potential shift from bullish to bearish.
            </p>
            <p>The pattern forms in three peaks:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Left Shoulder</strong> — price rises, then pulls back</li>
                <li><strong>Head</strong> — price rises higher than the first peak, then pulls back again</li>
                <li><strong>Right Shoulder</strong> — price rises to roughly the same level as the left shoulder, then declines</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                When the price drops below the "neckline" (the support level connecting the two pullback lows),
                the pattern is confirmed. Technicians expect further decline.
            </p>

            <h3>Reverse Head and Shoulders</h3>
            <p>
                The mirror image. If the market has been trending downward and forms a
                <span class="key-term">reverse head and shoulders</span> (three troughs with the middle
                one deepest), it signals a potential bullish reversal. The pattern is confirmed when price
                breaks above the neckline.
            </p>

            <h3>Moving Average</h3>
            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">moving average</span> smooths out short-term price fluctuations
                to reveal longer-term trends. It's calculated by averaging a security's closing prices
                over a set number of days.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
                <p>
                    The <strong>200-day moving average</strong> is the most widely followed. When a stock's
                    price crosses above its 200-day moving average, technicians interpret this as bullish.
                    When it crosses below, it's bearish. Portfolio managers at major firms watch this level
                    religiously—it's one of those self-fulfilling prophecies where enough people believe
                    in it that it actually affects trading behavior.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Market Strength Indicators</h3>
            <p>
                Technical analysts don't just study individual stocks—they study the health of the market
                itself. Several indicators help gauge market strength:
            </p>

            <h4>Short Interest Ratio</h4>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">short interest ratio</span> measures how many shares have been
                sold short relative to average daily trading volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's the contrarian logic: a high short interest ratio is actually considered
                <strong>bullish</strong>. Every short seller eventually has to buy shares to close
                their position. All those short positions represent future buying pressure—a "short
                squeeze" waiting to happen.
            </p>

            <h4>Odd Lot Theory</h4>
            <p>
                This is a classic <span class="key-term">contrarian indicator</span>. The theory holds
                that small investors—those buying fewer than 100 shares (an "odd lot")—tend to be wrong
                at market turning points.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If odd lot purchases increase → contrarian view: <strong>bearish</strong> (small investors are buying near the top)</li>
                <li>If odd lot sales increase → contrarian view: <strong>bullish</strong> (small investors are selling near the bottom)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The odd lot theory and short interest ratio are both contrarian
                    indicators. The exam loves to test whether you understand that these indicators say the
                    <em>opposite</em> of what you might initially expect.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Advance/Decline Index</h4>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">advance/decline index</span> measures market breadth—how many
                stocks are participating in a market move. Each day, the number of advancing stocks minus
                declining stocks is calculated and added to a running cumulative total.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Advance/Decline Example</div>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Day</th><th>Advances</th><th>Declines</th><th>Net</th><th>Cumulative</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>1</td><td>600</td><td>1,400</td><td>-800</td><td>-800</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2</td><td>800</td><td>1,200</td><td>-400</td><td>-1,200</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000</td><td>0</td><td>-1,200</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    A rising advance/decline line is bullish (broad market participation). A declining
                    line is bearish (fewer stocks participating in the rally).
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Put/Call Ratio</h4>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">put/call ratio</span> compares the volume of put options
                purchased to call options purchased. A high ratio (more puts than calls) means bearish
                sentiment prevails among traders. Contrarian technicians interpret this as a
                <strong>bullish</strong> signal—when everyone is pessimistic, the market is more likely to go up.

                <p>
                    When Benjamin Graham published <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> in 1949, he introduced
                    a concept he called "Mr. Market"—an imaginary business partner who shows up every day
                    offering to buy your shares or sell you his at a different price. Sometimes Mr. Market
                    is euphoric and overpays. Sometimes he's depressed and offers bargains. Graham's insight
                    was that you should take advantage of Mr. Market's mood swings, not be guided by them.
                    His most famous student? Warren Buffett, who has called the book "by far the best book
                    on investing ever written."
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Fundamental analysis</span> examines a company's financial statements
                to determine its intrinsic value. Where technical analysts study price charts, fundamental
                analysts study income statements and balance sheets. The goal: figure out whether a stock's
                current market price is justified by the company's actual financial health.
            </p>

            <h3>The Income Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">income statement</span> shows a company's financial performance
                over a period of time—typically a quarter or a year. Think of it as a movie, not a photograph:
                it captures what happened between two dates.

            <h4>Key Income Statement Terms</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">EBIT</span> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) — also called
                operating income. This shows how well the company's core business performs before financing
                costs and taxes enter the picture. It's the purest measure of operational profitability.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">EBITDA</span> — adds depreciation and amortization back to EBIT.
                Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures and depreciation methods,
                because it strips out non-cash charges.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">EBT</span> (Earnings Before Taxes) — EBIT minus interest expense.
                This shows profitability after all expenses except taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Net Income</span> — the "bottom line." This is what's left after
                all expenses, interest, and taxes. Net income is what's available to shareholders.
            </p>

            <h4>Earnings Per Share</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Earnings Per Share (EPS)</span> is arguably the single most watched
                number in all of corporate finance.
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">

                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Basic EPS = Net Income &divide; Shares Outstanding</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                If a company has convertible bonds, stock options, or warrants that could create additional
                shares, it must also report <span class="key-term">fully diluted EPS</span>—which assumes
                all convertible securities have been converted to common stock.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Fully diluted EPS will always be <em>equal to or lower than</em>
                    basic EPS, never higher. More shares in the denominator = smaller number. The exam tests
                    this concept frequently.

            <h3>The Balance Sheet</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">balance sheet</span> shows a company's financial position at a
                specific point in time—a snapshot, not a movie. It answers one fundamental question: what does
                this company own, what does it owe, and what's left for shareholders?
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity</strong><br>
                    This equation must always balance. If it doesn't, someone is going to prison.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Assets</strong> (what the company owns):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Current Assets</span> — cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses (convertible to cash within 12 months)</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Fixed Assets</span> — property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E)</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Intangible Assets</span> — goodwill, patents, trademarks</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Liabilities</strong> (what the company owes):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Current Liabilities</span> — accounts payable, notes payable, accrued liabilities, wages payable (due within 12 months)</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Long-term Liabilities</span> — bonds, mortgages, long-term debt</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Shareholders' Equity</strong> (what's left for owners):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common stock (par value) + Capital in excess of par + Retained earnings</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
                <p>
                    If a company's total equity is $1,528,000 and it has 100,000 shares outstanding, its
                    <strong>book value per share</strong> is $15.28. If the stock trades at $25, the market
                    is valuing the company at roughly 1.6&times; its book value—suggesting investors believe
                    the company is worth more than its accounting value.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Measures of Liquidity</h3>
            <p>
                Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations.
                The exam focuses on three:
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Working Capital</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Working Capital = Current Assets &minus; Current Liabilities</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Positive working capital means the company has enough short-term assets to cover short-term
                debts. Negative working capital is a red flag.
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Current Ratio</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Current Ratio = Current Assets &divide; Current Liabilities</div>
            </div>

            <p>A current ratio above 1.0 means the company can cover its short-term debts. Higher is generally better.</p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Quick Ratio (Acid Test)</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Quick Ratio = (Current Assets &minus; Inventory) &divide; Current Liabilities</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">quick ratio</span> (also called the <span class="key-term">acid test</span>)
                is a more conservative measure. It strips out inventory because inventory can't always be
                converted to cash quickly. If a company passes the acid test, it can meet short-term obligations
                even without selling any inventory.
            </p>

            <h3>Measures of Financial Leverage</h3>
            <p>Leverage ratios reveal how much debt a company carries relative to its equity and assets.</p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Debt-to-Equity Ratio</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt &divide; Total Equity</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Higher debt-to-equity = more leverage = more risk. A company financed primarily by debt
                is more vulnerable in downturns because interest payments are mandatory regardless of profitability.
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Debt Ratio</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Debt Ratio = Total Debt &divide; Total Assets</div>
            </div>

            <p>A ratio above 0.5 means more than half of the company's assets are financed by debt.</p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Interest Coverage (Times Interest Earned)</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Interest Coverage = EBIT &divide; Annual Interest Expense</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                This measures whether a company can comfortably pay the interest on its debt. A ratio of 5&times;
                means the company earns five times its interest expense. Higher is better—and lenders pay very
                close attention to this number.
            </p>

            <h3>Inventory Valuation</h3>
            <p>
                How a company values its inventory affects its reported profits and tax liability.
                The exam tests four methods:
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Inventory Methods in a Rising Price Environment</div>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Method</th><th>COGS</th><th>Reported Profit</th><th>Taxes</th></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>FIFO</strong> (First In, First Out)</td><td>Lower</td><td>Higher</td><td>Higher</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>LIFO</strong> (Last In, First Out)</td><td>Higher</td><td>Lower</td><td>Lower</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Average Cost</strong></td><td>Middle</td><td>Middle</td><td>Middle</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><strong>Specific Identification</strong></td><td>Actual cost per item</td><td>Varies</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Remember "FIFO = Fatter Income" in a rising price environment.
                    Because the oldest (cheapest) inventory is sold first, COGS is lower and profits appear
                    higher. LIFO has the opposite effect.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>Inventory Turnover</strong> = COGS &divide; Average Inventory. Higher turnover means
                the company is selling inventory more quickly—generally a sign of efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Accounts Receivable Turnover</strong> = Net Sales &divide; Average Accounts Receivable.
                Higher is better—the company is collecting on credit sales more efficiently.
            </p>

            <h3>Cash Flow Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">cash flow statement</span> tracks actual cash moving in and out
                of the company. It has three sections:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Operating Activities</strong> — cash from day-to-day business operations</li>
                <li><strong>Investing Activities</strong> — cash from buying/selling assets and investments</li>
                <li><strong>Financing Activities</strong> — cash from issuing stock, paying dividends, borrowing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                A company can report positive net income but still have negative cash flow (and vice versa).
                The cash flow statement reveals the truth behind the accounting.
            </p>

            <h3>Valuation Ratios</h3>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">P/E = Market Price per Share &divide; Earnings Per Share</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">P/E ratio</span> is the most widely used valuation metric.
                A high P/E may indicate the stock is overvalued—or that investors expect strong future growth.
                A low P/E may indicate undervaluation—or that the company's prospects are dim.
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">P/B = Market Price per Share &divide; Book Value per Share</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                A P/B ratio above 1.0 means the market values the company above its accounting (book) value.
                Most healthy, growing companies trade above book value.
            </p>

            <h4>Financial Footnotes</h4>
            <p>
                Don't skip the footnotes. Financial statement footnotes can reveal accounting methods used,
                contingent liabilities, related-party transactions, and off-balance-sheet items. On the
                exam—and in real life—the footnotes can completely change your interpretation of the numbers.

            <h2>Topic 3: Portfolio Analysis</h2>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                <p>
                    In 1952, a 25-year-old graduate student named Harry Markowitz published a 14-page paper
                    called "Portfolio Selection" in <em>The Journal of Finance</em>. His insight was deceptively
                    simple: investors should evaluate securities not in isolation but in the context of their
                    entire portfolio. Diversification wasn't just common sense—it could be mathematically
                    optimized. That paper earned him a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 and launched the entire
                    field of modern portfolio theory.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Portfolio analysis shifts the focus from individual securities to how those securities work
                together. The central question: how do you build a portfolio that maximizes return for a
                given level of risk?
            </p>

            <h3>Systematic vs. Nonsystematic Risk</h3>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Nonsystematic risk</strong> (company-specific, diversifiable) — can be reduced by adding more positions to a portfolio.<br>
                    <strong>Systematic risk</strong> (market risk, non-diversifiable) — cannot be diversified away. It affects the entire market.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                If your portfolio holds only one stock, a single piece of bad news can devastate its value.
                That's <span class="key-term">nonsystematic risk</span>—risk that's specific to a company or
                industry. Add more positions across different sectors and this risk shrinks.
            </p>
            <p>
                But no amount of diversification eliminates <span class="key-term">systematic risk</span>.
                When interest rates rise, nearly all bond prices fall. When the economy enters a recession,
                most stocks decline. That's market-wide risk, and it's always present.
            </p>

            <h3>Beta</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Beta</span> measures the correlation between a security's price
                movement and the overall market (typically the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0).
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Beta Quick Reference</div>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Beta</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Example</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>&gt; 1.0</td><td>More volatile than the market</td><td>High-tech stocks (beta ~1.2)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>= 1.0</td><td>Moves in line with the market</td><td>Broad market index fund</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>&lt; 1.0</td><td>Less volatile than the market</td><td>Utility companies (beta ~0.8)</td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>
                A stock with a beta of 1.2 is expected to be 20% more volatile than the market. If the market
                rises 10%, that stock should rise about 12%. If the market drops 10%, expect a 12% decline.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> High beta = high risk = high expected return. Conservative
                    clients should hold lower-beta portfolios. Aggressive growth investors tolerate higher betas.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>CAPM and the Risk Premium</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</span> provides a framework
                for calculating the expected return on a security.
            </p>

            <div class="calculation-box">
                <div class="calculation-box__label">CAPM Formula</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta &times; (Market Return &minus; Risk-Free Rate)</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">risk-free rate</span> is typically the Treasury bill rate.
                The difference between the market return and the risk-free rate is the
                <span class="key-term">risk premium</span>—the additional return investors demand for
                taking on market risk.
            </p>

            <h3>Alpha</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Alpha</span> measures the difference between a security's actual
                return and its expected return (as predicted by CAPM).

                <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
                <div class="calculation-box__formula">Alpha = Actual Return &minus; Expected Return</div>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positive alpha:</strong> the investment outperformed expectations. A fund manager who consistently generates positive alpha is "beating the market."</li>
                <li><strong>Negative alpha:</strong> the investment underperformed expectations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This is the heart of the active vs. passive management debate. Active managers believe
                skilled analysis can generate positive alpha. Passive investors argue that after fees and
                taxes, most active managers fail to deliver it consistently—which is why index funds exist.

            <h3>Asset Allocation Strategies</h3>

            <h4>Strategic Asset Allocation</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Strategic asset allocation</span> sets target percentages for each
                asset class based on the investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Sample Strategic Allocation</div>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Target</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Maximum</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>U.S. Government T-Bills</td><td>20%</td><td>5%</td><td>50%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Corporate Bonds</td><td>30%</td><td>15%</td><td>50%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Large-Company Stocks</td><td>50%</td><td>25%</td><td>75%</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The minimum and maximum ranges allow tactical adjustments based on market conditions—without
                    letting the manager go all-in on a single bet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Tactical Asset Allocation</h4>
            <p>
                Within the strategic framework, a manager can make <span class="key-term">tactical adjustments</span>—shifting
                weights toward asset classes that appear undervalued or away from those that appear overvalued.
                The minimum/maximum constraints prevent extreme positions.
            </p>

            <h3>Active vs. Passive Management</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Active management</span> relies on fundamental analysis to identify
                undervalued securities within each asset class. The goal is to generate returns above the
                benchmark (positive alpha). The trade-off: higher fees, higher transaction costs, and
                potential tax consequences from frequent trading.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Passive management</span> accepts that markets are generally efficient
                and uses index funds to match market returns at minimal cost. No attempt is made to beat the
                market—just to capture its returns with the lowest possible expenses.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Passive Rebalancing Plans</div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Constant Dollar Plan:</strong> A fixed dollar amount is allocated to equities.
                    If equities rise above this amount, the excess is transferred to bonds. If equities fall
                    below, bonds are liquidated to buy equities back to the target dollar amount.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Constant Ratio Plan:</strong> A fixed <em>percentage</em> is allocated to equities.
                    As prices change, the portfolio is rebalanced to maintain the target percentage across asset classes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Investment Styles</h3>

            <h4>Indexing</h4>
            <p>
                Using index funds that mirror a broad market benchmark (S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap, etc.)
                to achieve diversification efficiently. The premise: markets are efficient, so trying to beat
                them wastes time and money.
            </p>

            <h4>Growth Investing</h4>
            <p>
                Selecting stocks based primarily on earnings growth or stock price momentum. Growth investors
                seek companies whose earnings are growing faster than the market average, often accepting
                higher valuations in exchange for higher expected growth.
            </p>

            <h4>Value Investing</h4>
            <p>
                Selecting stocks that appear <span class="key-term">fundamentally undervalued</span> relative
                to their peers. Value investors examine P/E ratios, price-to-book ratios, and other fundamentals
                to find solid companies that are temporarily out of favor. The expectation: over time, the market
                will recognize the company's true worth and the stock price will rise to reflect it.
            </p>

                Chapter 17 brings together the analytical tools that drive investment decisions: reading charts,
                reading balance sheets, and building portfolios that match a client's risk profile.
                Whether those decisions add value after fees is a debate that has launched a thousand academic
                papers and at least one very successful index fund company in a suburb outside Philadelphia.
