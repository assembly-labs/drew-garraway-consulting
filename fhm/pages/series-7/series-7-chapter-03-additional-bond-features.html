            <p>
                In 1986, General Motors issued $1.25 billion in bonds with an 8.5% coupon—generous at the time.
                But by the early 1990s, interest rates had plummeted. GM was stuck paying top dollar while new
                issuers borrowed at half the rate. That costly lesson is why today virtually every corporate
                bond includes call provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond basic bond structure, bonds can include special features that significantly affect their
                value and behavior. Understanding these features—and the full spectrum of bond risks—is essential
                for advising clients.

            <h2>Section 1: Call and Put Features</h2>

            <h3>Why This Section Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Call features benefit issuers; put features benefit investors. Understanding which party
                benefits—and when they'd exercise these features—is essential for advising clients and
                passing your exam.
            </p>

            <h3>Bond Call Features</h3>

            <div class="historical-note">
                <div class="historical-note__label">Why Issuers Want Call Features</div>
                <p>
                    Think about it from the issuer's perspective: if you borrowed money at 8% and rates dropped
                    to 5%, wouldn't you want to refinance? That's exactly what callable bonds allow. The issuer
                    retires old high-rate debt and issues new bonds at lower rates. It's the corporate equivalent
                    of refinancing your mortgage—except bondholders are on the losing end.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                When a bond is <span class="key-term">callable</span>, the issuer has the right to
                <span class="key-term">call</span> (redeem) the bond before it matures. This forces bondholders
                to sell the bond back. Selling a bond back before maturity is known as
                <span class="key-term">redeeming</span> the bond.
            </p>

            <p>
                The callable bond's issuer doesn't owe any interest after redemption. This is a risk for the
                bondholder, known as <span class="key-term">call risk</span>. Issuers typically compensate
                bondholders for call risk in three ways:
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">How Issuers Compensate for Call Risk</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher coupon rate</strong> — Callable bonds usually offer higher rates than comparable non-callable bonds</li>
                    <li><strong>Call protection period</strong> — A period during which the bond cannot be called</li>
                    <li><strong>Call premium</strong> — An additional amount above par paid when the bond is called</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Call Protection</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Call protection</span> is a period during which the bond cannot be called.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Call Protection Example</div>
                <p>A 20-year bond issued in 2022 is first callable in 2032.</p>
                <p>The investor has 10 years of call protection—guaranteed interest payments for a decade.</p>
                <p>After 2032, the issuer can call the bond at any time.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Call Premium</h4>
            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">call premium</span> is an additional amount paid above par when a bond
                is called. Typically, the call premium declines over time:

                <ol>
                    <li>The issuer calls the bond</li>
                    <li>The issuer pays the final interest payment</li>
                    <li>The issuer returns principal plus any call premium</li>
                    <li>The issuer can now sell new bonds at lower rates</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>
                (A low call premium also makes a call more likely. If the issuer only has to pay 101 to retire
                a bond paying 8%, that's a bargain compared to years of above-market interest payments.)
            </p>

            <h3>Yield to Call (YTC)</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Yield to call (YTC)</span> measures how the call feature affects an
                investor's return if the issuer decides to call.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> When recommending callable bonds, the lesser of YTM or YTC must
                    be disclosed so clients understand the lowest potential yield. This is called
                    <span class="key-term">yield to worst (YTW)</span>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>YTC for Discount Bonds</h4>
            <p>
                When a bond trades at a discount, YTC is typically <strong>higher</strong> than YTM because
                the investor receives the gain between purchase price and par sooner.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Discount Bond Yield Relationship</div>

                </p>
                <p>YTC is highest because the discount is recovered sooner.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>YTC for Premium Bonds</h4>
            <p>
                When a bond trades at a premium, YTC is typically <strong>lower</strong> than YTM—bad news
                for investors. They lose the attractive higher-coupon payments sooner and lose the premium paid.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Premium Bond Yield Relationship</div>

                    <em>(lowest to highest)</em>
                </p>
                <p>YTC is lowest because the premium is lost sooner.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> You won't calculate YTC, but you must understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>YTC &gt; YTM for <strong>discount</strong> bonds</li>
                    <li>YTC &lt; YTM for <strong>premium</strong> bonds</li>
                    <li>YTW for discount bond = YTM</li>
                    <li>YTW for premium bond = YTC</li>

            </div>

            <h3>Bond Put Features</h3>

            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">put feature</span> gives the investor the right to sell the bond
                back to the issuer at a specified price (typically par). Also called a
                <span class="key-term">tender option</span>.

                </table>
            </div>

            <h4>When Do Investors Exercise Put Options?</h4>
            <p>
                When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. If the price drops below par, the bondholder
                can tender the bond and receive full par value, then reinvest at higher rates.

            <p>
                In 2008, Lehman Brothers bondholders learned a brutal lesson: even investment-grade debt can
                become worthless overnight. The firm's bonds, rated A just months before, recovered only pennies
                on the dollar in bankruptcy.

                <span class="key-term">Credit risk</span> (also <span class="key-term">default risk</span>)
                is the risk that the issuer cannot make interest and principal payments. The two main rating
                agencies are <span class="key-term">Moody's</span> and
                <span class="key-term">Standard & Poor's (S&P)</span>.

                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> S&P uses + or - modifiers (AA+, AA-). Moody's uses 1, 2, 3

                    Most institutions restrict investments to investment-grade bonds. Bonds below investment
                    grade are called <span class="key-term">junk bonds</span> or

            <h3>Interest Rate Risk and Price Volatility</h3>

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Interest rate risk</span> is the risk that rising rates will cause
                bond prices to fall. Bonds with long maturities or low coupons are most susceptible.
            </p>

            <h4>Variable-Rate Bonds</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Variable-rate bonds</span> have coupons that adjust to match market
                rates. Because the yield adjusts, the price stays close to par.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Variable-Rate Bond Behavior</div>
                <p>
                    When market rates rise, the variable-rate bond's coupon adjusts up, keeping the bond
                    trading near par. <strong>Result:</strong> Variable-rate bonds do not have significant
                    interest rate risk.
