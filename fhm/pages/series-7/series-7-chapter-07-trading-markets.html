            <div class="intro">
                <p>
                    On a spring morning in 1792, twenty-four merchants gathered beneath a buttonwood tree on Wall Street
                    and agreed to trade only with each other. That handshake deal gave birth to organized securities
                    trading in America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, most trades happen in microseconds across electronic networks, and the term "exchange" has
                    expanded far beyond any physical location. Understanding where and how securities trade is
                    fundamental to everything else on your Series 7 exam.

                <h2>Section 1: Types of Trading Markets</h2>

                <h3>Why This Section Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    The securities industry uses a numbering system to categorize different trading venues. These aren't
                    arbitrary labels—they reflect real differences in how trades are executed, who participates, and
                    what rules apply.
                </p>

                <h3>Primary vs. Secondary Markets</h3>
                <p>
                    The <span class="key-term">primary market</span> is where new securities are sold to the public for
                    the first time—IPOs and new bond issues. The <span class="key-term">secondary market</span> is where
                    those securities trade afterward between investors.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The distinction between exchange and over-the-counter trading goes back centuries. Exchanges
                        were formal buildings with membership rules; OTC trading happened informally in coffee houses
                        and on street corners. The technology has changed dramatically, but the conceptual distinction
                        persists.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>First Market: Exchange Trading</h3>
                <p>
                    The <span class="key-term">first market</span> refers to the trading of exchange-listed securities
                    on a major stock exchange. The largest stock exchange with a physical trading floor is the
                    <span class="key-term">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</span>. The largest U.S. stock exchange
                    overall is <span class="key-term">Nasdaq</span>, which has no physical trading floor.
                </p>

                <h4>Consolidated Quotation System (CQS)</h4>
                <p>
                    The <span class="key-term">Consolidated Quotation System (CQS)</span> creates current price quotes
                    for exchange-listed securities, regardless of where the quote is generated. This allows price
                    discovery between markets and arbitrage opportunities.
                </p>

                <h4>NYSE Designated Market Makers (DMMs)</h4>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">designated market maker (DMM)</span> is a firm that specializes in trading
                    specific securities. DMMs are wholesalers that deal primarily with NYSE members, always offering to
                    buy at one price (bid) and sell at a higher price (ask).
                </p>

                <h3>Second Market: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading</h3>
                <p>
                    Many securities cannot meet an exchange's listing requirements. Such securities trade
                    <span class="key-term">over-the-counter (OTC)</span>. Almost all corporate bonds and money market
                    instruments trade OTC, as do U.S. government bonds and municipal bonds.
                </p>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">OTC Markets Group Tiers</div>
                    <p>OTC Markets Group has 3 tiers based on disclosure levels:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>OTCQX</strong> — Premium companies</li>
                        <li><strong>OTCQB</strong> — Best-researched companies</li>
                        <li><strong>Pink Market</strong> — Speculative companies</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Third Market: OTC Trading of Exchange-Listed Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    OTC firms may also trade securities that are otherwise exchange-listed. This is the
                    <span class="key-term">third market</span>. Most trading occurs via
                    <span class="key-term">electronic communication networks (ECNs)</span>.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">ECN Advantages</div>
                    <p>
                        ECNs offer lower costs, allow institutional investors to trade directly without brokers, operate
                        24 hours a day, and provide anonymity.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Fourth Market: Direct Trading Between Institutions</h3>
                <p>
                    The fourth market is direct trading between institutions without a broker. A
                    <span class="key-term">dark pool</span> is a private trading system that allows participants to make
                    transactions without displaying quotes publicly.

                <p>
                    When a firm acts as a <span class="key-term">broker</span>, it serves as an agent earning
                    commissions. When acting as a <span class="key-term">dealer</span>, it's a principal putting its own
                    money at risk, earning markups or markdowns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    FINRA's <span class="key-term">5% Policy</span> suggests firms cannot charge more than 5% for a
                    commission, markup, or markdown. However, 5% is merely a guideline—the actual rule states
                    compensation must be fair and reasonable.

                        8.5%). Municipal bonds are also exempt but have similar MSRB rules requiring fair pricing.

                <p>
                    In 1867, Edward Calahan invented the stock ticker—a device that printed stock prices on paper tape.
                    Before that, you had to be on the trading floor to know what was happening. The ticker transformed
                    investing from a physical presence game to an information game.

                    <li>Order routed to exchange, market maker, ECN, or ATS</li>
                    <li>Order executed</li>

                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">long position</span> is an initial order to buy—the investor owns shares
                    and profits if the price rises. A <span class="key-term">short position</span> is an initial order
                    to sell borrowed shares—the investor profits if the price falls.

                <h3>Market Orders</h3>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">market order</span> executes immediately at the prevailing price. No price
                    is specified. Market orders will always be filled but may not be ideal for thinly traded securities
                    with wide spreads.
                </p>

                <h3>Limit Orders</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Limit orders</span> specify a price at which to buy or sell. The order
                    executes at that price or better—but may not fill at all if the limit price isn't reached.
                </p>

                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Buy limit orders are placed below market price. Sell limit orders are
                        placed above market price.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Stop Orders</h3>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">stop order</span> acts as a trigger. When the market price reaches the stop
                    price, the order converts to a market order. Stop orders are also called
                    <span class="key-term">stop-loss orders</span> because they help limit losses.
                </p>

                <h3>Stop Limit Orders</h3>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">stop limit order</span> converts to a limit order (not market order) when
                    triggered. This provides price protection but may not fill.

                <h3>Order Reductions</h3>
                <p>
                    When a cash dividend is paid, buy limits and sell stops (orders below market) are reduced. Stock
                    dividends and forward splits adjust both order size and price. Adjustments occur on the
                    <span class="key-term">ex-dividend date</span>.
