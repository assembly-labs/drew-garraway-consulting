            <p>
                On October 29, 1929, the stock market lost 12% of its value in a single day. Within three years,
                it would fall 89% from its peak. Fortunes evaporated. Banks failed. The Great Depression began.
                And Congress decided it was time to do something about the Wild West of securities sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result was the Securities Act of 1933, the first federal law requiring companies to tell
                investors the truth before taking their money. This chapter covers how companies bring new
                securities to market, the rules that govern the process, and the people who make it happen.

        <section id="section-1">
            <h2>Section 1: The Securities Act of 1933</h2>

            <p>
                Before 1933, companies could sell securities to the public with virtually no disclosure requirements.
                A promoter could spin tales of gold mines and oil wells, collect investors' money, and disappear
                into the sunset. The crash of 1929 finally convinced Congress that investors deserved better.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">The Two Purposes of the '33 Act</div>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> Require companies to publicly disclose all relevant financial information before offering securities for sale</li>
                    <li><strong>Antifraud:</strong> Prohibit fraud and deceit in the sale of securities</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Primary vs. Secondary Market</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">primary market</span> is where companies and governments raise money
                by selling new securities to investors. The proceeds go to the issuer. Think of it as buying
                directly from the source.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">secondary market</span> is where investors trade securities among
                themselves. When you buy Apple stock on the NYSE, Apple doesn't receive any of your money.
                It goes to whoever sold you the shares.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">The Primary Market is Also Called...</div>
                <p>
                    The <strong>capital market</strong>, because this is where issuers raise longer-term funding.
                    The '33 Act governs this market specifically.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Registration Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Nonexempt securities must be registered with the SEC before being offered for sale to the public.
                The first step is filing a <span class="key-term">registration statement</span> that contains:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Details about the company's business operations</li>
                <li>Information about management</li>
                <li>Description of the security being offered</li>
                <li>Plans for how the money raised will be used</li>
                <li>Financial statements certified by independent accountants</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Prospectus</h3>
            <p>
                Part of the registration statement becomes a <span class="key-term">prospectus</span>: the
                disclosure document given to investors. It provides all the information potential investors
                need to make an informed decision.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The SEC does NOT "approve" securities. It simply registers them
                    and allows them to be sold. The SEC doesn't judge whether a security is a good or bad
                    investment; it only ensures disclosure requirements are met.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Effective Date</h3>
            <p>
                Once the SEC determines that registration requirements have been met, the securities receive
                an <span class="key-term">effective date</span>. Only after this date can securities be sold
                to the public at the public offering price (POP).
            </p>

                    A copy of the prospectus must be sent to a customer <strong>at or before</strong> an offer
                    or sale of any registered primary offering.

            <h2>Section 2: Exempt Securities and Transactions</h2>

            <p>
                Not every security needs to go through the full SEC registration process. Some issuers and
                some transactions are exempt, either because they're already regulated elsewhere or because
                requiring full registration would be impractical.

                Securities sold only to residents within a single state may be exempt from federal registration.
                The logic: if everything stays in one state, let that state regulate it.

                <span class="key-term">Regulation A</span> provides a simplified registration process for

                To avoid the cost and time of full registration, issuers can sell to a private group of

            <p>
                When a company decides to go public, it typically doesn't sell shares directly to the public.
                Instead, it hires an <span class="key-term">investment banker</span> (or underwriter) to manage
                the offering, navigate the regulatory process, and distribute the securities.
            </p>

            <h3>Shelf Registration</h3>
            <p>
                A <span class="key-term">shelf registration</span> allows an issuer to file one registration
                statement for a large number of securities, then sell them over time as market conditions allow.
                It's like keeping securities "on a shelf" until you need them.

                <div class="critical-concept__label">Shelf Registration Timeline</div>
                <p>
                    Shelf registrations are valid for up to <strong>3 years</strong>. Securities can be sold
                    in portions over that time without filing a new registration statement.

                from the issuer at a discount, then resells them to the public. The underwriter takes on the
                risk of any unsold shares. This is the most common type for corporate offerings.
            </p>

            <h4>Best Efforts</h4>
            <p>
                In a <span class="key-term">best-efforts commitment</span>, the underwriter agrees to use its
                best efforts to sell the issuer's securities but does NOT guarantee all shares will be sold.
                The underwriter acts as an agent, not a principal, and is not liable for unsold shares.

            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Standby underwriting</span> is used with rights offerings. If existing
                shareholders don't purchase all the shares, the underwriter "stands by" to buy the remainder
                on a firm commitment basis.

            <h3>The Syndicate</h3>
            <p>
                For large offerings, the lead underwriter forms a <span class="key-term">syndicate</span>:
                a group of investment banks that share the risk and distribution responsibilities.

            <h3>Pre-Filing Period</h3>
            <p>
                Before the registration statement is filed, the issuer and underwriter can prepare materials
                and conduct due diligence, but they cannot offer or sell securities. No written materials
                about the offering can be distributed.
            </p>

            <h3>Cooling-Off Period</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">cooling-off period</span> (also called the waiting period) begins
                when the registration statement is filed and lasts at least 20 days while the SEC reviews it.
                During this time, limited communications are permitted.
            </p>

            <h4>What's Allowed During Cooling-Off</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oral offers:</strong> Representatives can discuss the offering with potential investors</li>
                <li><strong>Preliminary prospectus (red herring):</strong> Contains most information but NOT the final price or proceeds</li>
                <li><strong>Tombstone advertisement:</strong> Very limited announcement with issuer name, security type, and how to get more information</li>

                    The <span class="key-term">preliminary prospectus</span> is called a "red herring" because
                    of the red ink legend on its cover warning that the information is not final and subject

                FINRA limits underwriting compensation to prevent excessive spreads. If total compensation
                exceeds $500,000, a filing with FINRA is required.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Maximum Underwriting Compensation</div>
                <p>
                    Total underwriting compensation cannot exceed <strong>8% of gross proceeds</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>FINRA Rule 5130: Restricted Persons</h3>
            <p>
                Certain people are prohibited from purchasing IPO shares to ensure fair distribution of
                "hot" IPOs to the public.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Restricted Persons Include</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>FINRA member firms and their employees</li>
                    <li>Immediate family members of the above (spouse, parents, children, siblings, in-laws)</li>
                    <li>Finders or fiduciaries to the issuer</li>
                    <li>Portfolio managers who purchase IPOs for client accounts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Prohibited Practices</h3>

            <h4>Spinning</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Spinning</span> is allocating IPO shares to executives of a company
                in exchange for (or hope of) investment banking business. This is strictly prohibited.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: var(--fh-gray-600);">
                (Giving hot IPO shares to a CEO you're hoping will hire you to underwrite their next offering
                is the kind of quid pro quo that makes regulators very unhappy.)
            </p>

            <h4>Flipping</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Flipping</span> is quickly selling newly purchased IPO shares for a
                profit. While not illegal, underwriters discourage it and may penalize customers who flip
                by withholding future IPO allocations.
            </p>

            <h4>Free-Riding and Withholding</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Free-riding</span> is withholding shares of a new offering to sell
                later at a higher price. Broker-dealers must make a bona fide public distribution; they
                cannot hoard shares for their own benefit.
            </p>

            <h3>FINRA Rule 5121: Conflicts of Interest</h3>
            <p>
                When a member firm has a conflict of interest in an underwriting, additional protections
                are required.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">Conflicts Exist When</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>10% or more of net proceeds go to a FINRA member</li>
                    <li>FINRA member will use proceeds to pay debt to another member</li>
                    <li>Firm is issuing its own securities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When conflicts exist, a <strong>Qualified Independent Underwriter (QIU)</strong> must
                    perform due diligence and price the offering independently.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Regulation M: Market Manipulation</h3>
            <p>
                SEC Regulation M prohibits underwriters and issuers from manipulating the market during
                an offering. They cannot bid for or purchase securities in the secondary market during
                the distribution.
            </p>

            <h4>Exception: Stabilization</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Stabilization</span> is a limited exception allowing the managing
                underwriter to place a bid to support the price and prevent rapid decline during distribution.
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Stabilization Rules</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stabilizing bid must be at or BELOW the public offering price</li>
                    <li>Must be disclosed in the prospectus</li>
                    <li>Only the managing underwriter may place stabilizing bids</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Penalty Bids</h4>
            <p>
                If syndicate members' or customers' flip shares, the managing underwriter can impose a
                <span class="key-term">penalty bid</span>: reclaiming the selling concession from the
                broker whose customer flipped. This must be disclosed in the prospectus.

                Chapter 14 covers the birth of securities: how companies bring new securities to market,

                into a public one. Next up: the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which governs what happens
