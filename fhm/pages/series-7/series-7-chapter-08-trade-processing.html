            <p>
                In 1969, Wall Street nearly collapsed—not from a market crash, but from paperwork. Trading volume
                had exploded, and back offices couldn't keep up. Firms had to close on Wednesdays just to process
                the previous week's trades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, most trades settle in one business day. But the rules governing how trades are documented,
                what practices are prohibited, and how transactions are reported remain central to the Series 7 exam.

        <section id="section-1">
            <h2>Section 1: Order Tickets, Prohibited Practices, and Trade Reporting</h2>

            <h3>Order Tickets</h3>
            <p>
                To place a customer order in the secondary market, a registered representative fills out an order
                ticket electronically. The order ticket must specify: buy or sell, security name (ticker), order size,
                duration (day or GTC), whether discretionary, execution price, solicited/unsolicited, manager approval,
                and the representative's name.
            </p>

            <h4>Regulation SHO</h4>
            <p>
                Short sales are subject to SEC <span class="key-term">Regulation SHO</span>, which requires every
                sell order be marked as long or short. If short, the securities to be borrowed must be located by
                the broker before the sale.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Regulators are especially concerned that discretionary accounts might
                    be excessively traded (churned). Making a profit does not absolve the violation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Prohibited Trading Practices</h3>

            <h4>Best Execution</h4>
            <p>
                When executing an order, a firm must obtain the best outcome for the customer, considering price,
                volatility, liquidity, size and type of transaction, number of markets checked, and accessibility
                to markets.
            </p>

            <h4>Customer Orders Have Priority</h4>
            <p>
                The firm cannot give preference to its own orders over customer orders—this is called
                <span class="key-term">trading ahead</span>.
            </p>

            <h4>Front Running</h4>
            <p>
                When a firm receives a large block order, it cannot <span class="key-term">front-run</span> by
                placing the firm's orders ahead of the block.
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pump and dump:</strong> Trading pools inflate price, then sell</li>

            </div>

            <h3>Trade Reporting</h3>

            <p>
                Trades in listed securities must be reported to the consolidated tape. OTC equity trades must
                be reported within 10 seconds; bond trades within 15 minutes.

            <h2>Section 2: Trade Clearing and Settlement</h2>

            <p>
                After a trade is executed, it must be cleared and settled. Clearing involves ensuring both parties
                agree on terms. Settlement is the exchange of cash for securities.

            </div>

            <h3>Good Delivery Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Physical securities must be endorsed by the registered owner, with a
                <span class="key-term">signature guarantee</span> (medallion). Stock certificates must be in
                round lots of 100 shares or multiples that add to 100.
            </p>

            <h4>Buy-Ins and Sell-Outs</h4>
            <p>
                If a seller fails to deliver by T+4, the buyer may execute a <span class="key-term">buy-in</span>
                (forced purchase in open market). If a buyer fails to pay, the seller may execute a
                <span class="key-term">sell-out</span> (forced sale) immediately after settlement date.
            </p>

            <h3>Customer Confirmations</h3>
            <p>
                Confirmations must include: customer/firm information, security name, size and price, trade and
                settlement dates, CUSIP number, and whether agency or principal transaction.
            </p>

            <h3>Accrued Interest</h3>
            <p>
                On bond trades, the buyer pays accrued interest to the seller for the period from the last
                payment to the day before settlement. Corporate and muni bonds use 30/360 calculation;
                Treasuries use actual/365.

                With T+1 settlement, the <span class="key-term">ex-date</span> and
                <span class="key-term">record date</span> are now the same day. To receive the dividend,
                you must buy the stock at least one business day before the record date.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Be careful with dividend questions. A dividend declared in
                    December 2026 but paid in January 2027 counts as 2027 income for tax purposes.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Due Bills</h4>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Due bills</span> are required when a trade takes place before the ex-date
                but settles after the record date. The seller must forward the dividend to the buyer.
            </p>

            <h3>Stock Splits and Stock Dividends</h3>
            <p>
                Forward splits increase shares outstanding and decrease price proportionally. Reverse splits
                decrease shares and increase price. Stock dividends work similarly. No taxable event occurs
                since no cash is received.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unlike cash dividends, the ex-date for stock splits is the payable date + 1 business day.
            </p>
