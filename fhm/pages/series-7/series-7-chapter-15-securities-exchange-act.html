                On October 29, 1929, the stock market lost $14 billion in a single day. By the time the dust settled,
                investors had lost $30 billion—more than all of World War I cost the United States. The cause? A
                market with no rules, where manipulation was sport and insider trading was just good business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Congress responded with back-to-back legislation: the Securities Act of 1933 for new issues, and
                the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for everything after. The '34 Act created the SEC and established
                the rules that still govern secondary market trading today. One key difference: while the '33 Act has
                exemptions, the '34 Act's anti-fraud provisions apply to <em>everyone</em>—exempt or not.

            <h2>Section 1: The SEC and Market Manipulation</h2>

            <h3>The Birth of the SEC</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="key-term">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span> was created by the
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as the principal federal regulatory agency for the securities
                industry. The SEC writes the rules, enforces compliance, and can pursue both civil and criminal
                penalties against violators.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">What the SEC Regulates</div>
                <p>The SEC regulates <strong>nonexempt securities</strong>. It does NOT regulate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>General account insurance products</li>
                    <li>Commodities and futures contracts</li>
                    <li>Exempt securities (U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                <p>
                    <strong>No parties are exempt from the anti-fraud provisions of the '34 Act.</strong>
                    Whether you're trading exempt or nonexempt securities, fraud is fraud.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Prohibited Activities: Market Manipulation</h3>
            <p>
                A major focus of the '34 Act was to outlaw market manipulation. Before 1934, these practices
                were common—and profitable for those doing the manipulating. Today, they're all illegal:

            <h3>Civil Lawsuits for Manipulation</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to criminal penalties, guilty parties may face civil lawsuits from investors.
                The statute of limitations requires suits to be filed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Within <strong>2 years</strong> of discovering the violation</li>
                <li>But no later than <strong>5 years</strong> after the violation occurred</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Section 2: Insider Trading -->
        <section id="section-2">
            <h2>Section 2: Insider Trading Rules</h2>

            <h3>Who Is an Insider?</h3>
            <p>
                Under the '34 Act, an <span class="key-term">insider</span> is specifically defined as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An <strong>officer</strong> of the company</li>
                <li>A <strong>director</strong> of the company</li>
                <li>A <strong>10% shareholder</strong> of the company's equity securities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Insiders Cannot Do</h3>
            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Insider Restrictions</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No trading on MNPI:</strong> Cannot trade based on material nonpublic information</li>
                    <li><strong>No short swing profits:</strong> Profits from buying and selling (or vice versa) within 6 months must be returned to the issuer</li>
                    <li><strong>No short selling:</strong> Cannot sell their company's stock short (but buying protective puts IS allowed)</li>
                    <li><strong>Must report trades:</strong> File with SEC within 2 business days</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)</h3>
            <p>
                The definition of insider trading extends beyond officers and directors. Anyone who trades on
                <span class="key-term">Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)</span>—information not released
                to the public that could influence a security's price—can be liable.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">The Tipper-Tippee Problem</div>
                <p>
                    It's not just the person with inside information who's liable. If you pass MNPI to
                    someone who trades on it, <strong>both parties</strong> face prosecution:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tipper:</strong> The person who shared the information</li>
                    <li><strong>Tippee:</strong> The person who received it and traded</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <em>However</em>: If the tippee doesn't trade, neither party is guilty of insider trading.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Penalties for Insider Trading</h3>
            <p>Violators face serious consequences:</p>

            <p>Private parties have the right to sue under a <strong>6-year statute of limitations</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Information Barriers</h3>
            <p>
                Firms are required to create <span class="key-term">information barriers</span> (sometimes
                called "Chinese walls") to prevent MNPI from flowing between departments. For example,
                investment bankers working on a takeover might use code names, and the company's identity
                may only be known to a handful of senior people.
            </p>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Creating information barriers is a REQUIREMENT of the '34 Act,
                    not a violation. Stock analysts cannot share information with brokers until it's made public.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Rule 10b5-1: The Safe Harbor</h3>
            <p>
                Insiders can protect themselves from liability by establishing a <span class="key-term">prearranged
                trading plan</span> under Rule 10b5-1. This "safe harbor" rule lets officers, directors, and
                10% shareholders create a written plan specifying future trades. Once the plan is in force,
                the insider has no further influence on the trades—they happen automatically.

            <h3>Corporate Disclosure Requirements</h3>

                The '34 Act requires publicly traded companies to disclose information to the SEC—and

            <h3>Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)</h3>
            <p>
                Stock exchanges trading nonexempt securities must register with the SEC and become
                <span class="key-term">Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)</span>. They set their own
                trading rules, but the SEC has ultimate authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>FINRA</strong> (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) is also an SRO—an
                organization of broker-dealers that regulates its members. Most broker-dealers must
                join FINRA, and all FINRA rules require SEC approval.
            </p>

            <h3>Broker-Dealer Registration Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                The '34 Act requires most broker-dealers to register with the SEC and join FINRA.
                Once registered, firms must comply with several key requirements:

            <h2>Section 4: Other Federal Regulations</h2>

            <p>
                Beyond the '33 and '34 Acts, Congress has passed additional legislation to address
                specific market concerns. Here are the ones you need to know:
            </p>

            <h3>Trust Indenture Act of 1939</h3>
            <p>
                Corporate bonds issued in amounts over <strong>$50 million</strong> across state lines
                must use an indenture (a contract) and have a trustee appointed to protect bondholders.
                This does NOT apply to U.S. Treasury or municipal bonds.
            </p>

            <h3>Investment Company Act of 1940</h3>
            <p>
                This landmark legislation governs mutual funds and other investment companies. Key provisions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum <strong>$100,000</strong> in net assets to register</li>
                <li>Must have at least <strong>100 shareholders</strong></li>
                <li>At least <strong>40%</strong> of the board must be "disinterested" (independent)</li>
                <li>May borrow up to <strong>1/3 of total assets</strong> but must maintain 300% asset coverage</li>
                <li>Shareholders vote on: investment adviser, major policy changes, custodian changes, mergers</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">What Mutual Funds CANNOT Buy</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Securities on margin</li>
                    <li>Commodity contracts (futures)</li>
                    <li>Real estate and interests in real estate</li>
                    <li>Securities of companies undergoing reorganization (if it would make fund >10% owner)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Investment Advisers Act of 1940</h3>
            <p>
                Anyone who advises others about securities for compensation must register as an
                investment adviser. Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) must file Form ADV with
                the SEC and deliver a brochure to clients either:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>48 hours before entering into a contract, OR</li>
                <li>At the time of signing with a 5-day cancellation right</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure)</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Reg FD</span> prohibits issuers from selectively disclosing
                material nonpublic information. If you tell one analyst, you must tell the public.
                No favorites—everyone gets the same information at the same time.
            </p>

            <h3>Regulation SHO (Short Sales)</h3>
            <p>
                Reg SHO governs short selling with two key requirements:
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">Short Sale Rules</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Locate Requirement:</strong> Before executing a short sale, the broker must have
                    "reasonable grounds" to believe the security can be borrowed and delivered</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy-to-Borrow List:</strong> Updated daily; if a security is on this list,
                    no further locate inquiry needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Threshold List:</strong> Securities that are hard to borrow (10,000+ share fails
                    for 5+ consecutive days, equaling 0.5%+ of outstanding shares)</li>
                    <li><strong>Circuit Breaker:</strong> If a stock drops 10%+ from prior close, short sales
                    can only execute above the national best bid for the rest of that day AND the entire next day</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="test-tip">
                <p>
                    <strong>Test Tip:</strong> If someone owns convertible bonds and sells the underlying
                    common stock (planning to convert and deliver), this is a LONG sale, not a short sale.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Penny Stock Rules</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">Penny stocks</span> are priced at less than <strong>$5 per share</strong>
                and are usually unlisted (OTC). Due to their high risk, special rules apply:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Must determine suitability for each customer</li>
                <li>Must provide written risk disclosure and get written customer approval</li>
                <li>Must provide monthly statements with financial information</li>
                <li>May need to wait 2 days before completing transaction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</h3>
            <p>
                Under <span class="key-term">Reg BI</span>, broker-dealers must act in the best interest
                of customers when making recommendations. They cannot place their own financial interests
                ahead of the customer's. Form CRS (Customer Relationship Summary) is required.
            </p>

            <h3>Regulation S-P (Privacy)</h3>
            <p>
                Reg S-P governs how firms handle nonpublic personal information (NPI). Firms must have
                written privacy policies and give customers the right to "opt out" of having their
                information shared with nonaffiliated third parties.
            </p>

            <h3>Statutory Disqualification</h3>
            <p>
                Certain convictions disqualify individuals from the securities industry:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Felony:</strong> 10-year bar for convictions involving theft, fraud, bribery, perjury, embezzlement</li>
                <li><strong>Misdemeanor:</strong> Can result in indefinite disqualification if involving fraud, bribery, or perjury</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Bank Secrecy Act requires <strong>fingerprinting</strong> of all employees, directors, officers, and partners.

        <!-- Section 5: Investor Protection -->
        <section id="section-5">
            <h2>Section 5: Investor Protection: SIPC and FDIC</h2>

            <h3>Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="key-term">SIPC</span> was created in 1970 to protect customers when
                broker-dealers fail. Most broker-dealers are members. Here's what you need to know:
            </p>

            <div class="critical-concept">
                <div class="critical-concept__label">SIPC Coverage Limits</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total coverage:</strong> Up to $500,000 per customer</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash sublimit:</strong> Up to $250,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Securities in customer's name:</strong> Returned without limits</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box__title">What SIPC Does NOT Cover</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investment losses from market decline</li>
                    <li>Losses from fraud by the broker-dealer or its agents</li>
                    <li>Commodity futures contracts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Many broker-dealers purchase "excess SIPC" coverage—often up to $25 million or more—to
                provide additional protection beyond the standard limits.
                (Whether those additional policies are worth the marketing materials they generate is a question
                best left to the actuaries.)
            </p>
