                <p>
                    After the 1929 crash, Congress had a problem: the securities industry was a Wild West of bucket
                    shops, wash sales, and outright fraud. They could create federal securities laws, but who would
                    enforce them day-to-day? The answer came with the Maloney Act of 1938, which authorized
                    "self-regulatory organizations"&mdash;essentially letting the industry police itself under SEC
                    supervision. The logic was elegant: who better to spot bad actors than the professionals who work
                    alongside them?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, two SROs dominate the securities landscape: <strong>FINRA</strong> for the general securities
                    industry and the <strong>MSRB</strong> for municipal securities. Understanding their rules isn't
                    just exam material&mdash;it's the operating manual for your career. Every registration, every
                    customer communication, every gift you accept (or decline) is governed by what you'll learn in this
                    chapter.

            <section id="section-1">
                <h2>Section 1: FINRA Registration and Supervision</h2>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The Maloney Act of 1938 created the framework for non-exchange SROs. For decades, the NASD
                        served this role until 2007, when it merged with the NYSE's regulatory arm to form
                        FINRA&mdash;the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Today, FINRA oversees roughly 3,400
                        broker-dealers and 624,000 registered representatives.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Who Needs to Register?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not everyone at a broker-dealer needs to pass the Series 7. But more people than you might think
                    require <em>some</em> registration. The following individuals must register as
                    <span class="key-term">associated persons</span>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals who solicit orders</li>
                    <li>Individuals who train others to solicit orders</li>
                    <li>Supervisors of these activities</li>
                    <li>Anyone responsible for supervising financial services offered by RRs</li>
                    <li>Anyone with signature or approval authority for customer accounts</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The SIE exam alone does NOT qualify you to work in securities. You
                        must also pass a representative-level exam (like the Series 7) while sponsored by a member firm.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Registration Process</h3>
                <p>Registration involves several key forms and deadlines:</p>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">Form U4 and Form U5</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Form U4:</strong> Filed when joining a firm; creates your record with the Central
                            Registration Depository (CRD)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Form U5:</strong> Filed within <strong>30 days</strong> when leaving a firm; a copy
                            must be provided to the terminated individual
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Requalification:</strong> If you spend 2+ years without association, you must retake
                            your exams
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    FINRA prohibits firms from artificially extending this 2-year window by "parking" or "hanging" an
                    individual's registration. However, the
                    <span class="key-term">Maintaining Qualifications Program (MQP)</span> allows extending the period
                    from 2 to 5 years by completing annual continuing education&mdash;but only for those who've been
                    registered for at least one year.
                </p>

                <h3>BrokerCheck: Your Public Record</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">BrokerCheck</span> is FINRA's free public database where investors can
                    research the background of firms and representatives. It includes employment history, exam results,
                    and any disciplinary actions. Every year, member firms must provide customers with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The FINRA BrokerCheck hotline number</li>
                    <li>A statement about the availability of the BrokerCheck investor brochure</li>
                    <li>The FINRA website address</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Office Structure and Supervision</h3>
                <p>
                    Every broker-dealer must have a <span class="key-term">main office</span> with a supervisory
                    principal. Beyond that, firms operate through branch offices where customer securities activities
                    occur.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction (OSJ)</div>
                    <p>
                        An <strong>OSJ</strong> is where supervisory responsibilities are carried out. Not every branch
                        is an OSJ, but every OSJ must have a designated OSJ manager who is a registered principal. Think
                        of OSJs as the supervisory hubs in a firm's network.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Written Supervisory Procedures</h3>
                <p>Every firm must maintain written supervisory procedures (WSPs) that are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In effect at all times</li>
                    <li>Kept at each location (subject matter appropriate to that office)</li>
                    <li>Updated annually</li>
                    <li>Accessible to all employees</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Firms must also hold an <span class="key-term">Annual Compliance Meeting</span>&mdash;every
                    registered person must attend to review firm policies, regulatory updates, and training
                    requirements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your employer needs to know about your side hustles. FINRA requires registered persons to provide
                    <strong>prompt written notice</strong> of any outside business activities that involve
                    compensation&mdash;including board memberships, family businesses, or part-time work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exception? Charitable work without compensation and
                    <span class="key-term">passive investments</span> (where you invest but play no active role, like
                    being a limited partner in a DPP).
                </p>

                <h3>Fidelity Bond Coverage</h3>
                <p>
                    Every member firm must maintain <span class="key-term">fidelity bond coverage</span> on all
                    employees. This protects against losses from employee theft or misappropriation of
                    funds&mdash;because trust but verify is nice, but insurance is better.
                </p>

                <h3>Continuing Education Requirements</h3>
                <p>Registration isn't "one and done." FINRA mandates ongoing education through two elements:</p>

                <h3>Military Service Accommodations</h3>
                <p>FINRA provides special accommodations for registered persons entering active military service:</p>

                    <li>While inactive, the firm may allow continued commission payments on customer accounts</li>
                    <li>The person cannot perform regular duties</li>
                    <li>Continuing Education requirements are suspended</li>
                    <li>
                        The 2-year termination clock is <strong>tolled (paused)</strong> until 90 days after leaving
                        military service
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Packaged Product Compensation</h3>
                <p>
                    Compensation for selling pooled products (variable annuities, mutual funds, DPPs) is strictly
                    regulated. No associated person may accept compensation from anyone other than their employer
                    unless:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Their firm agrees to the arrangement</li>
                    <li>Payments are made through the employing firm</li>

                    <li>The firm maintains records including names, amounts, and any non-cash compensation</li>

                <h3>Customer Complaints</h3>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">customer complaint</span> is any written statement from a customer alleging
                    a grievance involving the firm's activities or representatives. Key rules:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>principal must handle all complaints</strong>, no matter how minor</li>
                    <li>
                        Firms must report to FINRA within <strong>30 days</strong> if aware of complaints involving:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allegations of theft, forgery, or misappropriation of funds</li>
                            <li>
                                Claims for damages over $15,000 (against associated person) or $25,000 (against firm)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Statistical and summary information must be filed by the 15th day of the month following the
                        calendar quarter
                    </li>

                    <div class="critical-concept__label">Record Retention: FINRA vs. MSRB</div>
                    <p>
                        Customer complaint records must be maintained at the OSJ for a minimum of
                        <strong>4 years</strong> under FINRA rules. However, the MSRB requires
                        <strong>6 years</strong> for municipal complaints. Know both numbers for the exam.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>FINRA Code of Arbitration</h3>
                <p>
                    When customer disputes over money can't be resolved informally, they go to arbitration. Most
                    customers agree to this by signing an arbitration agreement when opening their account.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">The Arbitration Process</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A 3-person panel hears the dispute (majority or all public arbitrators)</li>
                        <li>Arbitrators' findings are <strong>final and binding</strong> on all parties</li>
                        <li>Decisions generally cannot be appealed (except for alleged criminal behavior)</li>
                        <li>
                            Customer account agreements must highlight the predispute arbitration clause in plain
                            language
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Mediation</span> offers an alternative where both sides work with a neutral
                    mediator. Unlike arbitration, either side can withdraw at any time, and the mediator's decision is
                    not binding.
                </p>

                <h3>FINRA Code of Procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    The Code of Procedure handles complaints alleging FINRA rule violations&mdash;these are disciplinary
                    matters, not customer money disputes. The process:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complaint filed with FINRA Department of Enforcement (DOE)</li>
                    <li>DOE investigates; if meritorious, forwards to Office of Hearing Officers (OHO)</li>
                    <li>OHO sends to respondent; response due within approximately one month</li>
                    <li>OHO determines if violation occurred and appropriate penalties</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Appeal Process</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>First appeal:</strong> National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) at FINRA headquarters in
                        Maryland
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Second appeal:</strong> SEC</li>
                    <li><strong>Final appeal:</strong> Federal court</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Penalties</h3>
                <p>
                    FINRA can impose censure, suspension, expulsion, and fines proportionate to the offense. For
                    criminal matters, cases are forwarded to the SEC and Department of Justice.
                    <strong>FINRA cannot impose criminal penalties like jail time.</strong>
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Minor Rule Violation (MRV) Letters</div>
                    <p>
                        For minor complaints, FINRA may request the respondent sign an MRV letter accepting a finding of
                        violation. The respondent admits guilt to a minor offense and pays a maximum
                        <strong>$2,500 fine</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, an <strong>Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC)</strong> lets the respondent
                        accept findings and waive appeal rights without admitting guilt.

                <p>
                    FINRA classifies all communications into three buckets, each with different approval and filing

                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Institutional investors</span> include banks, insurance companies, registered
                    investment companies, broker-dealers, RIAs, entities with at least $50 million in assets, government
                    entities, and employee benefit plans with at least 100 participants.
                </p>

                <h3>Content Standards for All Communications</h3>
                <p>Every communication must adhere to principles of fair dealing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cannot omit material facts</li>
                    <li>Cannot be misleading</li>
                    <li>Cannot predict or project performance (with very limited exceptions)</li>
                    <li>Must be fair and balanced&mdash;benefits must be accompanied by related risks</li>
                    <li>Must disclose conflicts of interest</li>
                    <li>Must include firm name and contact information</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FINRA Filing Requirements</h3>
                <p>Filing requirements depend on how long the firm has been a FINRA member:</p>

                <h3>Gifts and Gratuities</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>$100 limit</strong> is one of the most tested rules: registered representatives are
                    prohibited from giving or receiving gifts worth more than $100 per person per year to or from
                    employees of another firm.

                        Note: This $100 limit applies between broker-dealer employees. The SEC has separate rules for
                        gifts to customers.

                <h3>Borrowing and Lending</h3>
                <p>
                    The general rule is simple:
                    <strong>representatives cannot lend money to or borrow money from customers.</strong> The exceptions
                    require written approval from the firm and a written agreement between the parties:

                <h3>Sharing in Customer Accounts</h3>
                <p>
                    Representatives generally cannot share in the profits or losses of customer accounts. However,
                    sharing is permitted when:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The customer provides prior written consent</li>
                    <li>The firm provides prior written approval</li>
                    <li>Sharing is <strong>proportionate to capital contribution</strong></li>
                    <li>Exception: Proportionality requirement waived for immediate family members</li>
                </ul>

                    <div class="critical-concept__label">Guarantees Against Loss</div>
                    <p>
                        Representatives <strong>CANNOT guarantee a customer against losses</strong>. This prohibition
                        applies to formal and informal agreements alike. Promising to "make a customer whole" if an
                        investment loses money is a serious violation.

                </div>

                <h3>Private Securities Transactions ("Selling Away")</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Selling away</span> refers to trades that a registered representative
                    executes outside the scope of their firm&mdash;essentially moonlighting in securities. The rule is
                    straightforward:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must provide <strong>prior written notice</strong> to the firm</li>
                    <li>All trading activity must go through or be supervised by the firm</li>
                    <li>The firm may approve and supervise, disapprove, or take no action (default = disapproval)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Section 6: MSRB Rules</h2>

                <p>
                    The <span class="key-term">Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)</span> creates rules for
                    broker-dealers, underwriters, investment advisers, and their representatives who deal in municipal
                    securities. Here's the twist: while the MSRB makes the rules, it doesn't enforce them. That job
                    falls to FINRA, the SEC, and various banking regulators.
                </p>

                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The MSRB has no regulatory authority over municipal issuers
                        themselves. It can only regulate the professionals who work with municipalities&mdash;a critical
                        distinction for the exam.

                <p>
                    MSRB rules for broker-dealers are enforced by the SEC and FINRA. For non-broker-dealer banks,
                    enforcement falls to the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC.

                <h3>MSRB Advertising Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    The MSRB definition of "advertising" includes any material for public media or promotional
                    literature to be disseminated to the public. Internal memos are excluded.
                </p>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MSRB Advertising Retention: 4 Years</div>
                    <p>
                        Unlike FINRA's 3-year retention for communications, the MSRB requires
                        <strong>4 years</strong> for advertising materials. Every municipal advertisement must be
                        approved in advance by a Municipal Securities Principal (Series 53) or General Securities
                        Principal (Series 24).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Political Contributions (Rule G-37)</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's where municipal finance gets interesting&mdash;and where careers can end quickly. A
                    <span class="key-term">Municipal Finance Professional (MFP)</span> is anyone who performs financial
                    advisory work or underwriting for municipal issuers.
                </p>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">The $250 Rule</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            An MFP can contribute up to <strong>$250 per election</strong> to a candidate they're
                            entitled to vote for
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Contributions above $250 (or any amount to candidates they cannot vote for) trigger a
                            <strong>2-year ban</strong> on municipal business with that issuer
                        </li>
                        <li>The ban applies to the entire firm, not just the individual</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    A registered representative who only deals with retail clients is not an MFP. But the moment they
                    negotiate underwriting terms with a municipal issuer, they become one&mdash;and subject to the rule.
                    The line can be surprisingly easy to cross.
                </p>
