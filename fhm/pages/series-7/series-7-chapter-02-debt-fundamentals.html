                <p>
                    In 1693, England was at war with France and nearly broke. King William III needed money fast. His
                    solution: sell bonds to the public—promises to repay with interest. The Bank of England was created
                    specifically to manage this debt. That basic structure—borrow now, pay interest later, repay
                    principal at maturity—hasn't changed in over 300 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the U.S. bond market exceeds $50 trillion. If you're going to advise clients on fixed income,
                    you need to understand how these instruments work at a fundamental level.

                <h2>Section 1: Bond Basics and Pricing</h2>

                <h3>Why This Section Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    When investors lend money to corporations, governments, or municipalities, they receive bonds as
                    evidence of that loan. Unlike equity investors who hope for growth, bond investors want
                    predictability: regular interest payments and return of their principal. The trade-off is upside
                    potential for downside protection—bondholders get paid before stockholders if a company fails.
                </p>

                <h3>What Is a Bond?</h3>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The word "bond" comes from the same root as "bind"—as in a binding agreement. When you buy a
                        bond, the issuer is legally bound to pay you. This legal obligation is what makes bonds
                        fundamentally different from stocks. A company can skip dividends without consequence; skip a
                        bond payment and creditors can force bankruptcy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">bond</span> is a fixed-income security that represents a loan from an
                    investor to an issuer that needs capital—typically a corporation, government entity, or
                    municipality. The issuer promises to pay interest periodically and repay the
                    <span class="key-term">principal</span> (the original loan amount) at
                    <span class="key-term">maturity</span>.
                </p>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">Key Relationship</div>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Perspective</th>
                            <th>Role</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Bond Issuer</td>
                            <td>Borrower = Debtor</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Bond Investor</td>

                    </table>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Unlike stockholders who own a piece of the business, bondholders are creditors who are owed money.
                    The bond itself is evidence of the issuer's <span class="key-term">indebtedness</span> to the
                    investor.
                </p>

                <h4>Par Value and Coupon Rate</h4>
                <p>
                    Bonds are issued with a stated face value called <span class="key-term">par value</span>—typically
                    $1,000 for corporate and government bonds. The bond pays interest based on its
                    <span class="key-term">coupon rate</span> (also called the
                    <span class="key-term">stated rate</span> or <span class="key-term">nominal yield</span>)—the annual
                    interest rate applied to the par value.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Bond Interest Example</div>
                    <p>ABC Corporation issues a $1,000 par value bond with an 8% coupon rate.</p>
                    <p>Annual interest = $1,000 × 8% = <strong>$80 per year</strong></p>
                    <p>Interest is typically paid semiannually, so the bondholder receives $40 every six months.</p>
                    <p>
                        At maturity, the investor receives the final coupon payment ($40) plus the $1,000 principal =
                        <strong>$1,040 total</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Unless told otherwise, assume bond interest is paid semiannually.
                        Read carefully—some questions ask for annual interest ($80), others ask for the next semiannual
                        payment ($40). This is a common trap.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Bond Certificate Types</h4>

                <div class="comparison-table">

                            <td>No longer issued</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Registered Bonds</strong></td>
                            <td>Owner's name printed; must be endorsed to transfer</td>
                            <td>Largely replaced</td>

                <p>
                    When bonds are held in <span class="key-term">street name</span>, the broker-dealer is listed as
                    owner rather than the customer. The customer remains the
                    <span class="key-term">beneficial owner</span>
                    and retains all benefits—interest payments, transfer rights, and principal repayment.
                </p>

                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> U.S. government and agency securities are now issued <em>only</em>
                        in book-entry form. No paper certificates exist for new Treasury issues.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    (Anyone who's watched a heist movie knows bearer bonds are the villain's favorite—anonymous and
                    negotiable. That's exactly why they were phased out. The IRS prefers knowing who owns what.)
                </p>

                <h3>Bond Structure</h3>

                <h4>Term Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">term bond</span> issue has every bond maturing on the same date with the
                    same interest rate. Corporate bonds and U.S. government bonds are typically term bond issues.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Term Bond Example</div>
                    <p>ABC Corporation issues $1,000,000 of 8%, $1,000 par bonds, all maturing in 30 years.</p>
                    <p>
                        Every bond within the issue is identical—same maturity date, same coupon rate, same payment
                        schedule.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>Zero-Coupon Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Zero-coupon bonds</span> pay no periodic interest. Instead, they're sold at a
                    deep <span class="key-term">discount</span> from par and redeemed at full par value at maturity. The
                    difference between purchase price and redemption value represents the interest earned.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Zero-Coupon Example</div>
                    <p>A 30-year zero-coupon bond is issued at $400.</p>
                    <p>At maturity, the bondholder receives $1,000 par value.</p>
                    <p>
                        The $600 difference ($1,000 - $400) represents the interest that would have been paid over 30
                        years—just received all at once at the end.
                    </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Why Zero-Coupons Exist</div>
                    <p>
                        Zero-coupon bonds solve a specific problem: reinvestment risk. With regular bonds, you receive
                        interest payments and must find somewhere to invest them. With zeros, there's nothing to
                        reinvest—your return is locked in at purchase. Investors saving for a specific future goal (like
                        college tuition in 18 years) love this certainty.

                <h4>Serial Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">serial bond</span> issue matures in stages over several years rather than
                    all at once. Part of the principal is repaid at set intervals until the entire issue is retired.
                    Because different maturities carry different risk levels, serial bonds have varying interest rates.

                <h2>Section 2: Interest Rates, Prices, and Yields</h2>

                <p>
                    In 1981, 10-year Treasury bonds yielded nearly 16%—an investor could lock in that rate for a decade
                    with U.S. government backing. Investors who bought then watched their bond prices soar as rates fell
                    over the following years. Those who waited and bought in 2020 at 0.5% rates learned the opposite
                    lesson when rates rose sharply in 2022.
                </p>

                <h3>Why This Section Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Interest rate risk is the primary risk for bondholders. When rates move, your bond's value moves in
                    the opposite direction. Understanding this inverse relationship—and the different ways to measure
                    bond yields—is essential for advising clients and passing the exam.
                </p>

                <h3>The Inverse Relationship Between Price and Yield</h3>
                <p>
                    When a bond is issued, its coupon rate reflects current market rates for similar securities. But
                    once issued, the bond's market price will fluctuate as interest rates change.
                </p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <div class="historical-note__label">Why This Relationship Exists</div>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you own a bond paying 5% when newly issued bonds suddenly pay 6%. Why would anyone buy
                        your 5% bond at full price when they could get 6% elsewhere? They wouldn't—unless your bond's
                        price dropped enough to make its effective yield competitive. This is the fundamental driver of
                        bond price movements.
                    </p>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">The Iron Law of Bond Investing</div>
                    <p>There is an <strong>inverse relationship</strong> between interest rates and bond prices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When interest rates <strong>RISE</strong>, existing bond prices <strong>FALL</strong></li>
                        <li>When interest rates <strong>FALL</strong>, existing bond prices <strong>RISE</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Prices adjust so that existing bonds offer yields competitive with newly issued securities.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Interest Rate Impact Example</div>
                    <p><strong>Scenario 1: Rates Rise</strong></p>
                    <p>Bond X has a 5% coupon. Market rates rise to 6%.</p>
                    <p>
                        Bond X becomes less attractive—new bonds pay more. Bond X's price falls until its yield equals
                        6%.
                    </p>
                    <p>Result: Bond X trades at a <strong>discount</strong> (below par).</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Scenario 2: Rates Fall</strong></p>
                    <p>Bond X has a 5% coupon. Market rates fall to 4%.</p>
                    <p>Bond X becomes more attractive—it pays more than new bonds. Buyers bid up the price.</p>
                    <p>Result: Bond X trades at a <strong>premium</strong> (above par).</p>

                <p>
                    (Bondholders in 2022 learned this lesson the hard way—the fastest rate increases in 40 years sent
                    bond prices tumbling. Meanwhile, bond investors in the 1980s who locked in 15% yields watched their
                    bond values climb steadily as rates fell over the next four decades.)
                </p>

                <h3>Understanding Bond Yields</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Yield</span> measures the return an investor earns on a bond. There are
                    several ways to calculate yield, and they tell you different things.
                </p>

                <h4>Nominal Yield (Coupon Rate)</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Nominal yield</span> is simply the coupon rate—the fixed interest rate stated
                    on the bond. Also called the <span class="key-term">stated yield</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 5% coupon bond always has a 5% nominal yield, regardless of what happens to market prices or
                    interest rates. Nominal yield never changes.
                </p>

                <h4>Current Yield</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Current yield</span> measures the annual return based on what you actually
                    paid for the bond:
                </p>

                <div class="calculation-box">
                    <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
                    <div class="calculation-box__formula">Current Yield = Annual Interest ÷ Current Market Price</div>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Current Yield at Par</div>
                    <p>Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon, trading at $1,000 (par)</p>
                    <p>Annual Interest = $50</p>
                    <p>Current Yield = $50 ÷ $1,000 = <strong>5%</strong></p>
                    <p>At par, current yield equals nominal yield.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Current Yield for Discount Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    When a bond trades below par, current yield exceeds nominal yield—you're earning the same dollar
                    interest on a smaller investment.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Discount Bond Current Yield</div>
                    <p>Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon, trading at $909.09 (discount)</p>
                    <p>Annual Interest = $50</p>
                    <p>Current Yield = $50 ÷ $909.09 = <strong>5.5%</strong></p>
                    <p>The investor pays less but receives the same $50 annually—higher effective return.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Current Yield for Premium Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    When a bond trades above par, current yield is less than nominal yield—you're earning the same
                    dollar interest on a larger investment.
                </p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Premium Bond Current Yield</div>
                    <p>Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon, trading at $1,100 (premium)</p>
                    <p>Annual Interest = $50</p>
                    <p>Current Yield = $50 ÷ $1,100 = <strong>4.55%</strong></p>
                    <p>The investor pays more but receives only $50 annually—lower effective return.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Yield to Maturity (YTM)</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Yield to maturity</span> is the most comprehensive yield measure. It accounts
                    for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual interest payments</li>
                    <li>The difference between purchase price and par value at maturity</li>
                    <li>Time until maturity</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">Yield Relationship Rules</div>
                    <p><strong>For Discount Bonds:</strong></p>
                    <p>Nominal Yield &lt; Current Yield &lt; Yield to Maturity</p>
                    <p>YTM is highest because you also gain the discount when the bond matures at par.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>For Premium Bonds:</strong></p>

                    <p>YTM is lowest because you lose the premium when the bond matures at par.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>For Par Bonds:</strong></p>
                    <p>Nominal Yield = Current Yield = Yield to Maturity</p>
                    <p>All yields equal when trading at par.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> You won't calculate YTM on the exam, but you must know: for discount
                        bonds, YTM &gt; current yield. For premium bonds, YTM &lt; current yield. Remember: discounts
                        add to your return; premiums subtract.

                <h4>Yield-Based Quotes and Price Movement</h4>
                <p>

                    still applies:

                    Chapter 2 establishes the fundamentals of debt securities. These concepts—par value, coupon rates,
