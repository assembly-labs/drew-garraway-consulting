                <p>
                    On February 3, 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, giving Congress the
                    power to tax income "from whatever source derived." The first Form 1040, filed that year, was four
                    pages long. Today, the Internal Revenue Code runs over 2,600 pages, and the regulations interpreting
                    it fill roughly 9,000 more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the Series 7, you don't need to be a tax attorney. But you absolutely need to understand how
                    different securities are taxed&mdash;because tax treatment is often the deciding factor in whether a
                    particular investment is suitable for a client. A municipal bond yielding 4% might actually put more
                    money in a high-bracket investor's pocket than a corporate bond yielding 6%. Understanding why is
                    the point of this chapter.

                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The Internal Revenue Service is part of the Department of the Treasury. It collects taxes and
                        enforces the Internal Revenue Code. But here's a distinction the exam tests: the IRS doesn't
                        prosecute tax evaders. That's the Department of Justice. The IRS identifies and audits; the DOJ
                        takes people to court.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Types of Income</h3>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Earned income</strong> &mdash; salaries, wages, bonuses, tips, commissions. Subject to
                        FICA taxes.<br />
                        <strong>Portfolio (investment) income</strong> &mdash; dividends, interest, capital gains. NOT
                        subject to FICA.<br />
                        <strong>Passive income</strong> &mdash; rental income, limited partnership income. Can only
                        offset passive losses.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    These categories matter because the IRS restricts how losses in one category can offset income in
                    another. You can't use a loss from a limited partnership to reduce your W-2 wages.
                </p>

                <h3>Capital Gains and Losses</h3>
                <p>
                    When an investor sells a security for more than they paid, the profit is a
                    <span class="key-term">capital gain</span>. The tax rate depends entirely on how long the security
                    was held:
                </p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Capital Gains Tax Rates</div>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Holding Period</th>
                            <th>Classification</th>
                            <th>Tax Rate</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>12 months or less</td>
                            <td>Short-term</td>
                            <td>Ordinary income rate</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>More than 12 months</td>
                            <td>Long-term</td>
                            <td>0%, 15%, or 20%</td>

                <p>
                    Short-term losses offset short-term gains first. Long-term losses offset long-term gains first. If
                    there's a net capital loss remaining, up to <strong>$3,000 per year</strong> can be deducted against
                    ordinary income. Any excess carries forward indefinitely.
                </p>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> The holding period is "more than 12 months" for long-term
                        treatment&mdash;not "12 months or more." One extra day matters.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="test-tip">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Profits from short sales are always treated as
                        <strong>short-term capital gains</strong>, regardless of how long the short position was held
                        open.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Determining Cost Basis</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Cost basis</span> is the purchase price plus commissions. Three methods for
                    identifying which shares were sold:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Specific identification</strong> &mdash; investor tells broker exactly which shares to
                        sell
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>FIFO (First In, First Out)</strong> &mdash; the IRS default</li>
                    <li><strong>Average cost</strong> &mdash; available only for mutual fund shares</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Cost Basis After a Stock Split</div>
                    <p>
                        You own 100 shares at $100 each (total basis: $10,000). After a 2-for-1 split, you own 200
                        shares. Your total basis is still $10,000, but your per-share basis is now $50. In a 1-for-5
                        reverse split: 20 shares at $500 each. Same $10,000 total basis.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Taxation of Dividends</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Qualified dividends</span> from corporate stock are taxed at the preferential
                    capital gains rate (15%, or 20% for the highest bracket).
                    <span class="key-term">Nonqualified dividends</span> are taxed at ordinary income rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interest from corporate bonds does NOT receive the qualified dividend rate&mdash;it's always
                    ordinary income.
                </p>
                <h4>Stock Dividends and Splits</h4>
                <p>
                    Stock dividends and stock splits are <strong>not taxable</strong> when received. They simply change
                    the per-share cost basis.
                </p>
                <h4>Dividends-Received Deduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Corporations receiving dividends from other corporations get a
                    <span class="key-term">dividends-received deduction</span> of 50% or more&mdash;making preferred
                    stock attractive for corporate investors.
                </p>
                <h4>Tax Reporting Forms</h4>
                <p>
                    Portfolio income is reported to the IRS by the payer. Dividends are reported on
                    <span class="key-term">Form 1099-DIV</span>, which details cash dividends, qualified dividend
                    amounts, capital gains distributions, and REIT distributions. Interest income is reported on
                    <span class="key-term">Form 1099-INT</span>, broken into taxable and nontaxable (municipal)
                    interest.
                </p>

                <h4>Mergers and Conversions</h4>
                <p>
                    Shareholders receiving stock in a merger generally face <strong>no taxable event</strong>.
                    Converting convertible preferred or bonds to common stock is also not taxable.
                </p>

                <h4>No Capital Events in Retirement Accounts</h4>
                <p>
                    Transactions inside tax-deferred retirement plans (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.) are
                    <strong>not capital events</strong>. Buying and selling within the account does not generate taxable
                    gains or losses. After-tax (Roth) contributions are also not considered capital events. Only
                    distributions from the account create a tax obligation.

                <p>
                    Buying a put on stock held short-term <strong>wipes out the holding period</strong>&mdash;it resets
                    to zero. If the put is exercised, the gain is short-term regardless of how long you held the stock.

                    Buy stock and a put <strong>on the same day</strong> = a <span class="key-term">married put</span>.
                    The IRS treats the put premium as part of the stock's cost basis. Holding period is based on the

                    <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
                    <p>
                        The tax exemption for municipal bond interest dates back to the Supreme Court's 1895 ruling in
                        <em>Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.</em>, which held that taxing state and local bond
                        interest was equivalent to taxing the states themselves. The exemption has survived for over a
                        century&mdash;making municipal bonds one of the most tax-advantaged investments available.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Bond Interest Taxation</h3>
                <p>
                    Interest from corporate bonds is taxed as ordinary income at all levels. However, bond interest paid
                    by a corporation is <strong>deductible against corporate taxes</strong>&mdash;unlike dividends paid
                    on stock. This is a powerful advantage for companies choosing to raise capital through debt rather
                    than equity.

                <h3>Reinvestment and Cost Basis</h3>
                <p>
                    Automatically reinvested dividends and capital gains are <strong>still taxable</strong> in the year
                    received. Reinvestment increases your cost basis (you're purchasing more shares at NAV).
                </p>
                <h3>Municipal Bond Fund Caveat</h3>
                <p>
                    Dividends from a municipal bond fund may represent <strong>tax-free income</strong>, but if the fund
                    buys and sells bonds at a profit, those capital gains are <strong>taxable to shareholders</strong>.
                    Tax-free applies only to the interest income, not to the fund's trading profits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, a fund's NAV may decline while investors still owe capital gains taxes&mdash;if the
                    fund sold appreciated securities inside the portfolio, those gains are distributed even though the
                    overall fund price dropped.
                </p>
                <h3>Switching Funds</h3>
                <p>
                    Exchanging shares between funds in a fund family is a <strong>taxable event</strong>. Don't confuse
                    with switching inside a 401(k), which is tax-sheltered.

                    If the annuity's value drops below the cost basis and the contract is fully surrendered, the loss
                    <strong>may be deductible</strong>.
                </p>
                <h4>Non-Qualified Annuity RMDs</h4>
                <p>
                    Non-qualified annuities have <strong>no required minimum distributions</strong> during the owner's
                    lifetime. (Beneficiary distribution rules apply upon death.)
                </p>
                <h4>Tax-Qualified Variable Annuities</h4>
                <p>
                    Qualified variable annuities are funded with <strong>pre-tax dollars</strong>. Because contributions
                    were never taxed, <strong>all distributions</strong> are taxed as ordinary income&mdash;both the
                    contributions and the earnings.
                </p>
                <h4>1035 Exchange</h4>
                <p>
                    A <span class="key-term">1035 exchange</span> allows a tax-free swap of one annuity for another, or
                    life insurance to annuity. You <strong>cannot</strong> exchange annuity to life insurance&mdash;that
                    direction is taxable.
                </p>

                <h2>Section 6: REITs &amp; DPPs</h2>
                <h3>REITs</h3>
                <p>
                    REITs distributing at least 90% of net investment income avoid entity-level taxation (<span
                        class="key-term"
                        >Subchapter M</span
                    >). Distributions are generally taxed as <strong>ordinary income</strong>.
                </p>
                <h3>Direct Participation Programs (DPPs)</h3>
                <p>
                    DPPs are <span class="key-term">pass-through entities</span>. The partnership pays no taxes. Income,
                    gains, losses, and deductions flow to partners via <strong>Schedule K-1</strong>.
                </p>
                <div class="critical-concept">
                    <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
                    <p>
                        DPP income is <strong>passive income</strong>. Passive losses can ONLY offset passive
                        income&mdash;never earned or portfolio income.<br /><br />Exception: up to $25,000 from
                        <strong>active participation in real estate rental</strong> can offset other income.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Tax Basis in a Partnership</h4>
                <p>
                    <span class="key-term">Tax basis</span> = maximum deductible losses. Established by: initial
                    investment, cash contributions, share of recourse debt, partnership income. Reduced by:
                    distributions, losses, debt reductions.
                </p>
                <h4>Tax Credits vs. Tax Deductions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tax deduction</strong>: reduces taxable income (value depends on bracket)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax credit</strong>: reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar (always more valuable)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Depreciation in DPPs</h4>
                <p>
                    Most real estate or equipment leasing partnerships generate deductions primarily through
                    <span class="key-term">depreciation</span>. For residential real estate, the IRS allows
                    straight-line depreciation over <strong>27.5 years</strong>. For example, a building acquired at
                    $2,500,000 generates approximately $90,909 per year in depreciation deductions.
                </p>
                <h4>At-Risk Rules and Nonrecourse Debt</h4>
                <p>
                    The IRS <span class="key-term">at-risk rules</span> limit loss deductions to the amount the investor
                    has "at risk"&mdash;generally the initial investment plus their share of
                    <strong>recourse debt</strong> (debt for which the investor is personally liable).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Exception:</strong> Real estate partnerships can include
                    <strong>nonrecourse debt</strong> in their tax basis. This exception does not apply to other types
                    of DPPs (oil/gas, equipment leasing, etc.).
                </p>
                <h4>Disposing of a Partnership Interest</h4>
                <p>
                    When a partner disposes of their interest, any <strong>suspended passive losses</strong> become
                    fully deductible.

                <p>
                    When a person dies, their estate may be subject to <strong>estate taxes</strong>&mdash;but the
                    person who inherits assets from the estate is <strong>not</strong> subject to estate taxes. That
                    obligation falls on the estate itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beneficiaries receive a <span class="key-term">stepped-up cost basis</span>&mdash;FMV on date of

                    by the <strong>donor</strong>. Recipient inherits the donor's cost basis and holding period.

                        Sell at a loss and buy the same or substantially identical security within
                        <strong>30 days before or after</strong> (61-day window) = loss <strong>disallowed</strong>. The
                        disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of replacement shares.

                <div class="info-box">
                    <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
                    <p>
                        You sell 300 shares of XYZ at a $1,200 loss. Two weeks later, buy back 300 shares. Wash
                        sale&mdash;the $1,200 loss is disallowed and added to your new cost basis.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    A wash sale is not illegal&mdash;you just can't claim the loss. A
                    <strong>municipal bond tax swap</strong> (selling one muni, buying a different one) avoids the wash
                    sale rule because the bonds aren't "substantially identical."

                    Chapter 18 covers the tax treatment of virtually every security type on the Series 7. The IRS Code
                    was designed to catch about 150 wealthy taxpayers who were paying zero federal income tax in 1969.
                    By 2017, the AMT alone was hitting over 5 million households. Congress has adjusted the rules
                    several times since, but the basic principle remains: the tax code giveth, and the tax code taketh
                    away.
