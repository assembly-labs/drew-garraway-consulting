# Suitability and Account Maintenance

## Introduction

In the early 2000s, FINRA investigators discovered a disturbing pattern: brokers were selling variable annuities with 15-year surrender periods to customers in their mid-80s. The math didn't work—these customers would likely need access to their money for healthcare costs long before the surrender period ended, or wouldn't be alive to benefit from the product's features. But the commissions were excellent.

One reason for collecting all that new account information is to ensure that future recommendations will be suitable for a particular customer. All regulators—including the <span class="key-term">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</span>, the <span class="key-term">Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)</span>, and the <span class="key-term">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span>—have established suitability standards. And as with all regulations, the SEC has the final say. <span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</span> is the ultimate standard for client suitability.

This section covers what it means to make suitable recommendations—and what happens when firms fail to do so.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Explain the three components of FINRA suitability requirements
- Understand Regulation Best Interest and its four obligations
- Describe Form CRS and its purpose
- Know account maintenance requirements for confirmations and statements
- Identify senior investor protection rules and trusted contact requirements

## FINRA and MSRB Suitability Requirements

Suitability isn't a vague concept—it has three specific, testable components.

### The Three Components of Suitability

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS - THREE SUITABILITY COMPONENTS</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Component</th>
        <th>What It Means</th>
        <th>Key Question</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Reasonable-Basis Suitability</strong></td>
        <td>The recommendation must be suitable for at least SOME investors</td>
        <td>"Would this product make sense for anyone?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Customer-Specific Suitability</strong></td>
        <td>The recommendation must be suitable for THIS specific customer based on their profile</td>
        <td>"Is this right for THIS customer?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Quantitative Suitability</strong></td>
        <td>A series of recommendations must be suitable in total, considering frequency and cost</td>
        <td>"Is this level of trading appropriate?"</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Quantitative suitability exists because of churning scandals. A single trade might be perfectly suitable, but executing 300 trades per year in a conservative investor's account is not—regardless of whether each individual trade was reasonable. The pattern matters.</p>
</div>

### Matching Investments to Investor Types

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Investor Type</th>
        <th>Objective</th>
        <th>Suitable Investments</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Conservative</strong></td>
        <td>Capital preservation, income</td>
        <td>Government bonds, money markets, blue-chip dividend stocks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Moderate</strong></td>
        <td>Balance of growth and income</td>
        <td>Balanced funds, investment-grade bonds, large-cap stocks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Aggressive</strong></td>
        <td>Capital appreciation</td>
        <td>Growth stocks, sector funds, emerging markets</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Speculative</strong></td>
        <td>Maximum returns, accepts high risk</td>
        <td>Options, penny stocks, leveraged products, DPPs</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### When Suitability Applies

Suitability obligations apply when a representative makes a <span class="key-term">recommendation</span>. They do NOT apply to:
- Unsolicited orders (customer initiates without recommendation)
- Self-directed accounts where the customer makes all decisions
- Institutional investors who affirmatively indicate they're exercising independent judgment

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> If an exam question describes a customer who places an order without any recommendation from the rep, suitability rules don't apply to that transaction. The key word is "recommendation."</p>
</div>

---

## Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)

<span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest</span> is an SEC rule that establishes a higher standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers. It went into effect in June 2020.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Reg BI rose from the ashes of a regulatory battle. In 2016, the Department of Labor finalized a "fiduciary rule" requiring brokers to act as fiduciaries when advising retirement accounts. The securities industry challenged it in court—and won. In 2018, the Fifth Circuit struck down the DOL rule as overreach. But the underlying problem remained: brokers could legally recommend products that paid them higher commissions even when better alternatives existed. The SEC stepped in with Reg BI as a middle ground—stronger than the old "suitability" standard, but not a full fiduciary duty. Critics called it a compromise; the SEC called it workable. Either way, it's now the law.</p>
</div>

### The Four Obligations

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">REG BI - FOUR OBLIGATIONS</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Obligation</th>
        <th>Requirement</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>1. Disclosure</strong></td>
        <td>Disclose all material facts about the relationship, including fees, conflicts of interest, and limitations on services</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>2. Care</strong></td>
        <td>Exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>3. Conflict of Interest</strong></td>
        <td>Establish policies to identify, disclose, and mitigate conflicts of interest</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>4. Compliance</strong></td>
        <td>Establish written policies and procedures to achieve compliance with Reg BI</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### The Care Obligation in Detail

The Care Obligation requires representatives to:
- Understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs of a recommendation
- Have a reasonable basis to believe the recommendation is in the customer's best interest
- Consider reasonably available alternatives
- Have a reasonable basis for any series of recommended transactions

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Best Interest vs. Fiduciary</div>
  <p>Reg BI requires acting in the customer's "best interest"—but it doesn't impose a full fiduciary duty like investment advisers have. Broker-dealers can still receive transaction-based compensation (commissions), but they must mitigate the conflicts this creates.</p>
</div>

---

## Form CRS: Customer Relationship Summary

<span class="key-term">Form CRS</span> (Customer Relationship Summary) is a disclosure document that broker-dealers and investment advisers must provide to retail investors.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Form CRS exists because investors couldn't tell the difference between a broker and an investment adviser—and the industry wasn't eager to explain. A 2006 RAND study commissioned by the SEC found that retail investors were deeply confused about who they were working with, what services they were getting, and what legal duties applied. Investors thought their "financial advisor" (a marketing term, not a legal one) was looking out for them—when that person might be a broker with no fiduciary duty at all. Form CRS, adopted alongside Reg BI in 2019, forces firms to explain the relationship in plain English. Four pages maximum, prescribed format, no fine print evasion.</p>
</div>

### Purpose

Form CRS helps investors understand:
- The types of services offered
- Fees and costs
- Conflicts of interest
- Legal standard of conduct
- Disciplinary history

### Delivery Requirements

- Must be provided at or before the **earliest of**: a recommendation, placing an order, or opening an account
- Maximum **4 pages** for broker-dealers (or 4 pages for the BD portion if a dual registrant)
- Must use **plain English** and a prescribed format

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Form CRS must be delivered before or at the time of a recommendation—not after. This ensures the customer has information about the relationship before making decisions based on recommendations.</p>
</div>

---

## Continuing Maintenance of Accounts

Once an account is open, firms have ongoing obligations to keep customers informed about their accounts and transactions.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Before the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the secondary market was the Wild West. Major companies like Westinghouse and Singer didn't even publish income statements or balance sheets. Brokers could execute trades and customers might never know what they paid in commissions—or even what price they got. After the 1929 crash revealed how much manipulation and fraud had flourished in this opacity, Congress mandated transparency. Trade confirmations, account statements, and disclosure requirements all flow from this principle: investors have a right to know what's happening in their accounts. Every piece of paper your firm sends is a descendant of Depression-era reforms.</p>
</div>

### Trade Confirmations

A <span class="key-term">trade confirmation</span> must be sent to customers for each transaction.

**Timing:**
- Sent **at or before the completion of the transaction** (settlement)
- In practice, confirmations are typically sent **promptly after execution**

**Required Information:**
- Security traded (name, quantity)
- Price and total amount
- Trade date and settlement date
- Commission or markup/markdown
- Whether the firm acted as agent or principal
- Capacity (broker or dealer)

### Account Statements

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Account Type</th>
        <th>Statement Frequency</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Standard accounts</td>
        <td><strong>Quarterly</strong> (at minimum)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Accounts with penny stocks</td>
        <td><strong>Monthly</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Accounts with no balance/activity</td>
        <td>No statement required for that quarter</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Statements must show:
- All positions in the account
- Current market value
- A legend telling customers to promptly report any inaccuracies or discrepancies to the firm (the phone number given **cannot** be that of the representative)

### Customer Mail

<span class="key-term">Firms cannot generally hold customer mail.</span> Statements and confirmations must be sent to:
- The address on the new account form, OR
- A P.O. Box designated by the customer

Customer mail **cannot** be directed to the registered representative's office.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The mail hold restrictions exist because fraudsters discovered a simple trick: if you control the mail, you control what the customer knows. Dishonest brokers would have statements sent to their own offices, intercept them, and hide unauthorized trading, churning, or outright theft—sometimes for years. By the time the customer discovered the problem, the money was long gone. FINRA's strict limits on holding mail ensure that statements reach customers directly, making fraud much harder to conceal. The three-month exception exists for legitimate reasons (like customers traveling abroad), but "convenience" explicitly doesn't qualify.</p>
</div>

**Exception:** If the customer requests in writing, mail can be held for up to **3 months**. If the customer wants mail held longer, their written instruction must include an acceptable reason (e.g., safety or security concerns). FINRA states that **convenience is NOT an acceptable reason** for holding mail longer than 3 months.

### Business Continuity Plans

FINRA requires firms to create and maintain a <span class="key-term">Business Continuity Plan (BCP)</span> that identifies the procedures to be followed if there is an emergency or significant business disruption.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The BCP requirement emerged directly from September 11, 2001. When the towers fell, they took out critical financial infrastructure—backup generators, communication systems, and trading floors. The securities industry showed impressive resilience in recovering, but regulators saw vulnerabilities. What if the next disruption was worse? In 2004, FINRA (then NASD) adopted rules requiring every member firm to have a written business continuity plan. The goal: ensure that customer accounts remain accessible even when buildings don't.</p>
</div>

At account opening, the firm must disclose, in writing, how its BCP addresses the possibility of significant business disruption and how it plans to respond. The BCP disclosure must also be:
- Posted on the firm's website
- Mailed to customers on request

### Account Ownership

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Accounts Are Property of the Firm</div>
  <p>If a registered representative leaves a broker-dealer for any reason, all accounts are considered to be the property of the firm. The broker-dealer will allocate the departing representative's accounts among the existing representatives at that firm.</p>
</div>

If a representative inherits an account (e.g., from a retiring representative or one who has left the firm), the account documents must be **updated prior to making any transactions** in the account.

### Transfer of Accounts Within the Firm

If a customer wishes to have their account transferred to another broker at the **same firm**, the branch manager must approve. There is no requirement to complete another new account form. However, <span class="key-term">discretionary power cannot be transferred</span>—the client would need to provide written discretionary authority to their new representative.

### Proxy Materials

To facilitate trading, the ownership of a security is usually registered in the name of the broker-dealer. The purchaser is still the <span class="key-term">beneficial owner</span> of the security, meaning they maintain all the rights of ownership, including dividends and voting rights. This kind of registration is called holding securities in <span class="key-term">street name</span> (because many broker-dealers were located on Wall Street).

A firm that holds securities in street name must **forward all information** it receives from the issuer (such as annual reports) to the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner's investment adviser.

The SEC requires companies to send shareholders a <span class="key-term">proxy statement</span> prior to every stockholders' meeting. Whenever an issuer delivers proxy materials to a firm and promises to reimburse the firm for out-of-pocket expenses, the member firm must promptly send those materials to the beneficial owner.

A proxy statement provides information relevant to upcoming votes, such as:
- The election of individuals to the board of directors
- The election or ratification of the company's accountant
- Authorization of new securities issues
- The modification or exchange of securities
- Any other submitted shareholder resolutions

## Senior Citizen Rules

The <span class="key-term">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</span> has stated that a customer's age and life stage are both important factors when determining suitability. As investors age, their investment time horizons, goals, risk tolerance, and tax status often change, and liquidity takes on added importance.

### Typically Unsuitable Recommendations for Seniors

FINRA has stated that it does not prohibit any particular recommendation to a senior citizen if it is suitable. However, certain types of recommendations are <span class="key-term">red flags</span>:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">RED FLAGS FOR SENIOR INVESTORS</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Purchase of <strong>variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities, and real estate limited partnerships</strong></li>
    <li>Purchase of <strong>variable life settlements</strong></li>
    <li>Purchase of <strong>complex structured products</strong> such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)</li>
    <li>A recommendation to <strong>mortgage their residence</strong> to obtain funds for investment purposes</li>
    <li>A recommendation to use <strong>retirement savings</strong>, including early withdrawals from IRAs, to invest in <strong>high-risk investments</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Senior Certifications

FINRA is concerned about registered representatives using bogus certifications when making presentations to senior citizens.

Claiming to be a:
- Certified Senior Adviser
- Certified Financial Gerontologist
- Senior Specialist
- Retirement Specialist

...is **prohibited** since these are not true professional designations.

If a representative has an **independently conferred designation** that requires rigorous training, such as a <span class="key-term">CFP (Certified Financial Planner)</span> or <span class="key-term">CPA (Certified Public Accountant)</span>, these designations can be used.

### Trusted Contact Person

FINRA requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name and contact information of a <span class="key-term">trusted contact person</span> when opening an account for a client.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The trusted contact requirement (FINRA Rule 4512, effective February 2018) addresses a frustrating gap that brokers faced for years. A representative would notice signs that an elderly client was being exploited—perhaps by a caregiver or family member—but had no one to call. Privacy rules prevented sharing account information with anyone except the customer. Meanwhile, the exploitation continued. The trusted contact person gives firms a lifeline: someone they can call to verify the customer's wellbeing without violating privacy rules. It's not a power of attorney. It's more like an emergency contact for your money.</p>
</div>

The member must disclose in writing to the client that the firm or associated person will be authorized to contact the trusted contact person to:
- Disclose information about the client's account to address possible financial exploitation
- Confirm the specifics of the client's current contact information or health status
- Obtain the identity of any legal guardian, executor, trustee, or holder of a power of attorney

### Diminished Mental Capacity

Firms must train their employees to identify diminished mental capacity. FINRA requires that firms have an internal process to permit representatives to get advice from others as to what steps to take.

**Document suspicions:** The representative should document the suspected diminished capacity and escalate immediately. The firm should have a clearly designated individual to whom the matter is directed.

Once the problem is identified and escalated, the next step for the firm is to **stop trading in the account** until the concern no longer exists. Then the firm should:
- Communicate with the customer's designated emergency contact person (next of kin) or a person given power of attorney over the account to discuss the situation
- Maintain frequent contact with the investor to assess the situation and notify legal or compliance about these conversations
- Consult appropriate state statutes to determine the next steps, which may include alerting appropriate authorities, including government protective services

### Financial Exploitation of Senior Citizens

FINRA allows firms to place temporary holds on disbursements from client accounts when fraud is suspected. The investors who FINRA believes are particularly susceptible to financial exploitation are:

- Individuals aged **65 or older**; or
- Individuals aged **18 or older** where the member believes that the individual has a mental or physical impairment that makes the individual unable to protect their own interests

FINRA calls these vulnerable individuals <span class="key-term">specified adults</span>.

If a rep suspects financial exploitation, the rep should immediately report this to the appropriate person within the firm. The rep may also want to discuss their concerns directly with the customer.

### The 15-Business Day Hold

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>FINRA Rule 2165 (effective February 2018) solved a legal catch-22. Before this rule, if a broker suspected a customer was being exploited and refused to process a suspicious disbursement, the broker could be sued for breach of contract. But if they processed it and the money disappeared to a scammer, they'd face regulatory scrutiny for failing to protect a vulnerable customer. Rule 2165 created a "safe harbor"—firms can now place temporary holds on suspicious disbursements without legal liability, giving them time to investigate. Every year, millions of seniors lose billions of dollars to financial exploitation. This rule gives firms a tool to fight back.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">TEMPORARY HOLD TIMELINES</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Situation</th>
        <th>Hold Duration</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Initial hold for suspected fraud</td>
        <td><strong>15 business days</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Extension if review supports exploitation belief</td>
        <td>Additional <strong>10 business days</strong> (25 total)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>If state or federal investigation begins</td>
        <td>Additional <strong>30 days</strong> (55 total)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Note that this hold only applies to **suspicious disbursements**, not to ones that are not suspicious.

If a hold is put on the account, the member must document why it has done so and must notify the <span class="key-term">trusted contact person</span> named on the account, assuming the trusted contact person is not the exploiter.

## Summary

Suitability requirements ensure that recommendations match customer needs and circumstances. The three components—reasonable-basis, customer-specific, and quantitative suitability—work together to protect investors from inappropriate recommendations.

Regulation Best Interest raises the bar further with its four obligations: Disclosure, Care, Conflict of Interest, and Compliance. Form CRS ensures customers understand the nature of their relationship with the firm.

Account maintenance requirements—confirmations, statements, and proper handling of mail and proxy materials—keep customers informed. And the senior citizen rules recognize that age brings unique vulnerabilities that deserve special protection.

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Three suitability components**: Reasonable-basis, customer-specific, quantitative
2. **Reg BI four obligations**: Disclosure, Care, Conflict of Interest, Compliance
3. **Form CRS**: 4 pages max, delivered before or at recommendation
4. **Confirmations**: Sent at or before settlement
5. **Statements**: Quarterly (monthly for penny stocks)
6. **Mail hold**: 3 months with written request; longer requires acceptable reason
7. **Trusted contact**: Required effort to obtain at account opening
8. **Temporary holds**: 15 business days initial, extendable to 55 days total
9. **Specified adults**: Age 65+ or 18+ with impairment

## Chapter Summary

Chapter 10 covered the full lifecycle of individual customer accounts: from the initial information gathering and identity verification, through the suitability analysis for recommendations, to the ongoing maintenance and special protections for vulnerable investors.

The regulations in this chapter aren't arbitrary bureaucracy—they're responses to real failures. Every requirement for customer identification traces back to the USA PATRIOT Act's response to 9/11. Every suitability rule exists because brokers once sold inappropriate products to unsuitable customers. Every senior protection measure addresses documented cases of exploitation.

Understanding the "why" behind these rules makes them easier to remember—and easier to apply when you're actually working with customers in the securities industry.
