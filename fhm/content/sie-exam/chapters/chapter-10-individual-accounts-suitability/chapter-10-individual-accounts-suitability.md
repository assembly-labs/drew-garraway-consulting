## Introduction

In 2009, a man named Allen Stanford was arrested at his girlfriend's home in Virginia. He'd been
running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme through certificates of deposit issued by an offshore bank in
Antigua—a bank he happened to own. Stanford had been knighted by Antigua, sponsored international
cricket tournaments, and cultivated an image of tropical respectability. Sophisticated investors
handed him billions.

How did no one catch this earlier? Among other failures, the answer involves inadequate customer
identification, insufficient due diligence, and a system that didn't ask enough questions about
where the money was really going.

Every rule in this chapter exists because someone, somewhere, got burned. The paperwork you'll
encounter when opening customer accounts isn't bureaucratic busywork—it's the financial industry's
scar tissue from decades of fraud, money laundering, and exploitation.

## The New Account Form

Opening a brokerage account requires collecting specific information. The exam tests your knowledge
of what's required versus what's merely helpful.

### Required Information

**MEMORIZE THIS - REQUIRED NEW ACCOUNT INFO:**

The following **MUST** be obtained when opening a customer account:

- **Name and residence** (a P.O. Box alone is insufficient)
- **Date of birth**
- **Social Security Number or Tax ID**
- **Citizenship or resident alien status**
- **Employment status and employer information**
- **Whether associated with another FINRA member firm**

### Suitability Information

Beyond basic identification, firms must gather information to make suitable recommendations:

- **Financial situation** — income, net worth, liquid net worth
- **Investment objectives** — growth, income, capital preservation, speculation
- **Investment experience** — knowledge level with different products
- **Risk tolerance** — how much volatility can they stomach?
- **Time horizon** — when will they need the money?
- **Liquidity needs** — how quickly might they need access to funds?

#### What If the Customer Won't Provide Information?

Customers can refuse to provide suitability information. If they do, the firm can still open the
account, but the representative cannot make recommendations. Without knowing the customer's
situation, there's no basis for determining what's suitable.

### What's NOT Required

**TEST TIP:** The exam loves to ask what's NOT required on new account forms. Remember:

- **A customer signature is NOT required** to open an account
- Neither is the customer's investment knowledge level (though it's useful for suitability)
- Watch for questions that try to trick you into thinking a signature is mandatory

### Principal Approval

A principal must approve each new account. The timing depends on the type of trade:

- **Solicited orders** (recommended by the rep): Principal approval required **before** the first
  transaction
- **Unsolicited orders** (initiated by the customer): Principal approval must occur **promptly
  after** the transaction

### Real-World Example: The Missing Signature

In 2015, FINRA fined a major brokerage firm $8 million for opening thousands of accounts without
obtaining proper account documentation. Some representatives, eager to meet sales quotas, would
process trades first and collect paperwork later—or sometimes never. The firm claimed that since
customer signatures aren't technically required, this was acceptable. FINRA disagreed: while
signatures aren't required, the **information** on the account form is mandatory, and you can't
approve what doesn't exist.

---

## Customer Identification Program (CIP)

The **USA PATRIOT Act** was passed in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Among
its many provisions, it requires financial institutions to implement a **Customer Identification
Program (CIP)**.

### Historical Context: Pre-9/11 Account Opening

Before the USA PATRIOT Act, opening a brokerage account was surprisingly casual. The 9/11 Commission
found that some of the hijackers had opened accounts at major financial institutions with minimal
verification. The CIP requirements exist to make the financial system a less hospitable place for
terrorists and money launderers.

### CIP Requirements

Firms must:

1. **Obtain identifying information** — name, date of birth, address, identification number
2. **Verify identity** — using documentary methods (government-issued ID) or non-documentary methods
   (checking databases, references)
3. **Compare against government lists** — check if the customer appears on any terrorist watch lists
4. **Maintain records** — keep identification records for **5 years after the account is closed**

**EXAM TRAP - RECORD RETENTION:** CIP records must be kept for **5 years after the account is
closed**—not 5 years from account opening. If an account is open for 20 years, you're keeping those
records for 25 years total.

### Know Your Customer (KYC)

**Know Your Customer (KYC)** goes beyond basic identification. It requires firms to use reasonable
diligence to understand the customer's investment profile and to keep that information current.

KYC means understanding:

- The customer's financial situation
- Their investment experience and objectives
- Whether recommendations are suitable
- Any red flags that might indicate problematic activity

#### Historical Example: The Bernard Madoff Case

Bernard Madoff's $64.5 billion Ponzi scheme (discovered in 2008) revealed catastrophic KYC failures.
Feeder funds sent billions to Madoff without understanding his strategy. When asked how he generated
consistent returns, Madoff gave vague answers about a "split-strike conversion strategy." His
auditor operated out of a 13x18 foot office in a strip mall. Basic due diligence—knowing your
customer and how they operate—would have raised red flags. The KYC principle applies not just to
retail customers but to understanding any party you're doing business with.

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

The **Bank Secrecy Act** established the framework for detecting and preventing money laundering in
the United States.

### Historical Context: Why the Bank Secrecy Act Exists

The Bank Secrecy Act was passed in 1970 when Congress realized organized crime families were using
banks to launder cash from drug trafficking and illegal gambling. By requiring cash transaction
reports, Congress hoped to create a "paper trail" that law enforcement could follow.

Within two years, the BSA was invoked in the Watergate investigation—the scandal that gave "money
laundering" its permanent place in our vocabulary. The $10,000 CTR threshold has remained unchanged
since 1970 (worth about $80,000 in today's dollars), which is why regulators focus so heavily on
"structuring"—criminals breaking transactions into smaller amounts to avoid reporting.

### AML Program Requirements

Financial institutions must implement AML programs that include:

- Written AML procedures
- Designation of an AML compliance officer
- Employee training
- Independent testing of the program

### Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)

A **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)** must be filed when a firm detects potentially suspicious
activity.

**SAR FILING REQUIREMENTS:**

| Requirement               | Details                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Threshold**             | $5,000 or more in suspicious activity         |
| **Filing deadline**       | Within 30 calendar days of detection          |
| **Filed with**            | FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) |
| **Customer notification** | PROHIBITED — do NOT tell the customer         |

**TEST TIP:** Never tell a customer that a SAR has been filed. This is called "tipping off" and is
prohibited. If a customer asks why certain transactions are being questioned, do not mention the
SAR.

### Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)

Banks (not broker-dealers directly, but the banks they work with) must file **Currency Transaction
Reports (CTRs)** for cash transactions exceeding **$10,000**.

### Monetary Instrument Logs (MILs)

A **Monetary Instrument Log (MIL)** must be maintained when a customer uses **cash between $3,000
and $10,000** to purchase negotiable instruments such as:

- Cashier's checks
- Money orders
- Traveler's checks

### Quick Reference: AML Thresholds

| Report/Log | Threshold        | What Triggers It                        |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **MIL**    | $3,000 - $10,000 | Cash purchase of negotiable instruments |
| **SAR**    | $5,000+          | Suspicious activity                     |
| **CTR**    | $10,000+         | Cash transactions (banks)               |

### Real-World Example: Structuring to Avoid Detection

In 2015, former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was indicted not for the misconduct he was trying to
hide, but for "structuring"—withdrawing cash in amounts just under $10,000 to avoid CTR reporting.
Between 2010 and 2014, he made 106 withdrawals of $9,000 each. Banks noticed the pattern and filed
SARs. The FBI investigated. Hastert ultimately pleaded guilty. The lesson: patterns of
just-below-threshold transactions are often more suspicious than large transactions that get
properly reported.

## Regulation S-P: Privacy Rules

**Regulation S-P** governs how financial institutions handle customer privacy. The "S-P" stands for
"Safeguarding Personal" information.

### Historical Context: The 1999 Privacy Compromise

Regulation S-P exists because of a trade-off Congress made in 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act tore
down the Depression-era walls between banks, securities firms, and insurance companies—allowing them
to merge and cross-sell products. Great for consumers, but terrifying for privacy advocates: now
your bank could share your financial information with affiliated brokerage and insurance arms.

Consumer groups demanded protection. The result was Title V of the Act, which the SEC implemented as
Regulation S-P in 2000. Every privacy notice you receive exists because Congress let the financial
industry consolidate—and privacy was the price of admission.

### Privacy Notice Requirements

Firms must provide customers with:

1. **Initial Privacy Notice** — delivered at account opening, explaining:
   - What information is collected
   - How it will be used
   - With whom it may be shared

2. **Annual Privacy Notice** — provided every year the account remains open

### Opt-Out Rights

Customers have the right to **opt out** of having their information shared with **non-affiliated
third parties**. However, they cannot opt out of information sharing with:

- Affiliated companies (within the same corporate family)
- Third parties processing transactions
- Regulatory agencies

### The Safeguards Rule

Regulation S-P also includes the **Safeguards Rule**, requiring firms to protect customer
information from unauthorized access. This means implementing security measures for both physical
records and electronic data.

### Real-World Example: The Capital One Data Breach

In 2019, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in Capital One's cloud configuration and accessed
personal information of over 100 million credit card applicants and customers. Capital One was fined
$80 million by the OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) for failing to implement adequate
safeguards—a direct violation of the principle behind Regulation S-P. The fine sent a message:
protecting customer data isn't optional, and "we got hacked" isn't a defense if you didn't have
proper safeguards in place.

---

## Trading Authorizations

### Power of Attorney

A customer can grant another person authority over their account through a **power of attorney**:

| Type                          | Also Called                | Authority Granted                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Limited Power of Attorney** | Trading Authorization      | Trade in the account (no withdrawals) |
| **Full Power of Attorney**    | Full Trading Authorization | Trade AND withdraw funds              |

### Discretionary Accounts

A **discretionary account** gives the representative authority to make trading decisions without
consulting the customer for each transaction. This is a significant grant of trust—and one that has
been abused.

#### Historical Context: The Churning Scandals

Discretionary authority has been at the heart of numerous scandals. In the churning cases of the
1990s, some brokers made hundreds of trades per year in elderly clients' accounts—not because the
trading strategy required it, but because each trade generated commissions. One notorious case
involved 300 trades in a widow's account in a single year. That's why discretionary accounts have
strict requirements.

### Requirements for Discretionary Authority

- **Written authorization** from the customer is required
- The authorization form must be **approved by a principal**
- Each discretionary order must be **identified as such** when entered
- All discretionary orders must be **reviewed by a principal** on the day entered

### What's NOT Discretionary

**TEST TIP:** If a customer gives a representative authority over **time and/or price only**, this
is NOT considered discretionary. Why? The customer has still decided what to buy or sell—they've
just given the rep flexibility on execution.

**Example:** "Buy 100 shares of Apple sometime today when you think the price is right" = NOT
discretionary.

**The Three A's Rule:**

- Discretion over **Asset, Action, or Amount** = Discretionary account required
- Discretion over **Time and Price only** = NOT discretionary (good for same day only)

### Real-World Example: Unauthorized Trading

In 2018, FINRA barred a broker who made unauthorized trades in customer accounts, claiming he had
"verbal permission." The broker argued that long-standing customers had given him informal
discretion over the years. FINRA didn't buy it: discretionary authority must be in writing, approved
by a principal, and properly documented. Verbal permission doesn't count. The broker's customers
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in unsuitable trades before the firm caught on.

## Accounts for Employees of Other Firms

When opening an account for someone employed by another FINRA member firm, special rules apply to
prevent conflicts of interest and ensure proper oversight.

### Requirements

1. **Written notification** — The employing firm must be notified in writing before or promptly
   after opening the account

2. **Duplicate statements** — Upon request from the employer, duplicate account statements and
   confirmations must be sent to the employing firm

3. **Employer may refuse** — The employing firm can instruct you not to open the account for their
   employee

### Why These Rules Exist

Firms want to know if their employees are trading elsewhere. An employee with accounts at multiple
firms might be front-running, manipulating markets, or engaging in other problematic behavior that
would be harder to detect without consolidated oversight.

### Real-World Example: The Front-Running Scheme

In 2016, a broker at a major Wall Street firm was trading ahead of his own firm's large
institutional orders. He'd see that his firm was about to buy 500,000 shares of a stock, quickly buy
call options in his personal account at another broker-dealer, then profit when the large order
moved the market. His employing firm had no idea—the personal account was at a different firm, and
that firm had never notified the employer as required. When regulators finally connected the dots,
the broker faced criminal charges. Proper notification would have triggered scrutiny much sooner.

## Suitability Requirements

In the early 2000s, FINRA investigators discovered a disturbing pattern: brokers were selling
variable annuities with 15-year surrender periods to customers in their mid-80s. The math didn't
work—these customers would likely need access to their money for healthcare costs long before the
surrender period ended, or wouldn't be alive to benefit from the product's features. But the
commissions were excellent.

One reason for collecting all that new account information is to ensure that future recommendations
will be suitable for a particular customer. All regulators—including FINRA, the MSRB, and the
SEC—have established suitability standards.

### The Three Components of Suitability

**MEMORIZE THIS:**

| Component                         | What It Means                                                                         | Key Question                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Reasonable-Basis Suitability**  | The recommendation must be suitable for at least SOME investors                       | "Would this product make sense for anyone?" |
| **Customer-Specific Suitability** | The recommendation must be suitable for THIS specific customer based on their profile | "Is this right for THIS customer?"          |
| **Quantitative Suitability**      | A series of recommendations must be suitable in total, considering frequency and cost | "Is this level of trading appropriate?"     |

#### Historical Context: Why Quantitative Suitability Exists

Quantitative suitability exists because of churning scandals. A single trade might be perfectly
suitable, but executing 300 trades per year in a conservative investor's account is not—regardless
of whether each individual trade was reasonable. The pattern matters.

### Matching Investments to Investor Types

| Investor Type    | Objective                          | Suitable Investments                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conservative** | Capital preservation, income       | Government bonds, money markets, blue-chip dividend stocks |
| **Moderate**     | Balance of growth and income       | Balanced funds, investment-grade bonds, large-cap stocks   |
| **Aggressive**   | Capital appreciation               | Growth stocks, sector funds, emerging markets              |
| **Speculative**  | Maximum returns, accepts high risk | Options, penny stocks, leveraged products, DPPs            |

### When Suitability Applies

Suitability obligations apply when a representative makes a **recommendation**. They do NOT apply
to:

- Unsolicited orders (customer initiates without recommendation)
- Self-directed accounts where the customer makes all decisions
- Institutional investors who affirmatively indicate they're exercising independent judgment

**TEST TIP:** If an exam question describes a customer who places an order without any
recommendation from the rep, suitability rules don't apply to that transaction. The key word is
"recommendation."

### Real-World Example: The Auction Rate Securities Crisis

In 2008, thousands of investors found themselves trapped holding auction rate securities
(ARS)—long-term bonds marketed as cash equivalents. Brokers had told conservative investors that ARS
were "just like money market funds" and suitable for emergency funds. When the auction market froze
during the financial crisis, investors couldn't access their money for years. The securities weren't
suitable for investors who needed liquidity, even though they might have been suitable for other
investors. This violated customer-specific suitability. Major firms paid billions in settlements.

---

## Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)

**Regulation Best Interest** is an SEC rule that establishes a higher standard of conduct for
broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers. It went into effect in June 2020.

### Historical Context: The Rise of Reg BI

Reg BI rose from the ashes of a regulatory battle. In 2016, the Department of Labor finalized a
"fiduciary rule" requiring brokers to act as fiduciaries when advising retirement accounts. The
securities industry challenged it in court—and won. In 2018, the Fifth Circuit struck down the DOL
rule as overreach.

But the underlying problem remained: brokers could legally recommend products that paid them higher
commissions even when better alternatives existed. The SEC stepped in with Reg BI as a middle
ground—stronger than the old "suitability" standard, but not a full fiduciary duty. Critics called
it a compromise; the SEC called it workable. Either way, it's now the law.

### The Four Obligations

**REG BI - FOUR OBLIGATIONS:**

| Obligation                  | Requirement                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Disclosure**           | Disclose all material facts about the relationship, including fees, conflicts of interest, and limitations on services |
| **2. Care**                 | Exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations                                             |
| **3. Conflict of Interest** | Establish policies to identify, disclose, and mitigate conflicts of interest                                           |
| **4. Compliance**           | Establish written policies and procedures to achieve compliance with Reg BI                                            |

### The Care Obligation in Detail

The Care Obligation requires representatives to:

- Understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs of a recommendation
- Have a reasonable basis to believe the recommendation is in the customer's best interest
- Consider reasonably available alternatives
- Have a reasonable basis for any series of recommended transactions

### Best Interest vs. Fiduciary

Reg BI requires acting in the customer's "best interest"—but it doesn't impose a full fiduciary duty
like investment advisers have. Broker-dealers can still receive transaction-based compensation
(commissions), but they must mitigate the conflicts this creates.

### Real-World Example: The Share Class Problem

A common Reg BI violation involves mutual fund share classes. Suppose a fund offers:

- **Class A shares**: 5.75% front-end load, 0.25% annual 12b-1 fee
- **Class C shares**: No front-end load, 1.00% annual 12b-1 fee

For a $100,000 investment held for 10 years, Class A is better for the customer (lower total cost).
But Class C pays the broker higher ongoing compensation. Before Reg BI, brokers could recommend
Class C because it was "suitable"—the fund itself was fine. After Reg BI, brokers must consider
reasonably available alternatives and choose what's in the customer's best interest, not what
maximizes compensation.

---

## Form CRS: Customer Relationship Summary

**Form CRS** (Customer Relationship Summary) is a disclosure document that broker-dealers and
investment advisers must provide to retail investors.

### Historical Context: Ending the Confusion

Form CRS exists because investors couldn't tell the difference between a broker and an investment
adviser—and the industry wasn't eager to explain. A 2006 RAND study commissioned by the SEC found
that retail investors were deeply confused about who they were working with, what services they were
getting, and what legal duties applied.

Investors thought their "financial advisor" (a marketing term, not a legal one) was looking out for
them—when that person might be a broker with no fiduciary duty at all. Form CRS, adopted alongside
Reg BI in 2019, forces firms to explain the relationship in plain English. Four pages maximum,
prescribed format, no fine print evasion.

### Purpose

Form CRS helps investors understand:

- The types of services offered
- Fees and costs
- Conflicts of interest
- Legal standard of conduct
- Disciplinary history

### Delivery Requirements

- Must be provided at or before the **earliest of**: a recommendation, placing an order, or opening
  an account
- Maximum **4 pages** for broker-dealers (or 4 pages for the BD portion if a dual registrant)
- Must use **plain English** and a prescribed format

**TEST TIP:** Form CRS must be delivered before or at the time of a recommendation—not after. This
ensures the customer has information about the relationship before making decisions based on
recommendations.

## Account Maintenance

Once an account is open, firms have ongoing obligations to keep customers informed about their
accounts and transactions.

### Historical Context: Why Transparency Matters

Before the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the secondary market was the Wild West. Major companies
like Westinghouse and Singer didn't even publish income statements or balance sheets. Brokers could
execute trades and customers might never know what they paid in commissions—or even what price they
got.

After the 1929 crash revealed how much manipulation and fraud had flourished in this opacity,
Congress mandated transparency. Trade confirmations, account statements, and disclosure requirements
all flow from this principle: investors have a right to know what's happening in their accounts.
Every piece of paper your firm sends is a descendant of Depression-era reforms.

### Trade Confirmations

A **trade confirmation** must be sent to customers for each transaction.

**Timing:**

- Sent **at or before the completion of the transaction** (settlement)
- In practice, confirmations are typically sent **promptly after execution**

**Required Information:**

- Security traded (name, quantity)
- Price and total amount
- Trade date and settlement date
- Commission or markup/markdown
- Whether the firm acted as agent or principal
- Capacity (broker or dealer)

### Account Statements

**STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:**

| Account Type                      | Statement Frequency                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Standard accounts                 | **Quarterly** (at minimum)             |
| Accounts with penny stocks        | **Monthly**                            |
| Accounts with no balance/activity | No statement required for that quarter |

**Statements must show:**

- All positions in the account
- Current market value
- A legend telling customers to promptly report any inaccuracies or discrepancies to the firm (the
  phone number given **cannot** be that of the representative)

### Customer Mail

**Firms cannot generally hold customer mail.** Statements and confirmations must be sent to:

- The address on the new account form, OR
- A P.O. Box designated by the customer

Customer mail **cannot** be directed to the registered representative's office.

#### Historical Context: The Mail Hold Fraud

The mail hold restrictions exist because fraudsters discovered a simple trick: if you control the
mail, you control what the customer knows. Dishonest brokers would have statements sent to their own
offices, intercept them, and hide unauthorized trading, churning, or outright theft—sometimes for
years. By the time the customer discovered the problem, the money was long gone.

FINRA's strict limits on holding mail ensure that statements reach customers directly, making fraud
much harder to conceal. The three-month exception exists for legitimate reasons (like customers
traveling abroad), but "convenience" explicitly doesn't qualify.

**Exception:** If the customer requests in writing, mail can be held for up to **3 months**. If the
customer wants mail held longer, their written instruction must include an acceptable reason (e.g.,
safety or security concerns). FINRA states that **convenience is NOT an acceptable reason** for
holding mail longer than 3 months.

### Business Continuity Plans

FINRA requires firms to create and maintain a **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** that identifies the
procedures to be followed if there is an emergency or significant business disruption.

#### Historical Context: Lessons from 9/11

The BCP requirement emerged directly from September 11, 2001. When the towers fell, they took out
critical financial infrastructure—backup generators, communication systems, and trading floors. The
securities industry showed impressive resilience in recovering, but regulators saw vulnerabilities.

What if the next disruption was worse? In 2004, FINRA (then NASD) adopted rules requiring every
member firm to have a written business continuity plan. The goal: ensure that customer accounts
remain accessible even when buildings don't.

At account opening, the firm must disclose, in writing, how its BCP addresses the possibility of
significant business disruption and how it plans to respond. The BCP disclosure must also be:

- Posted on the firm's website
- Mailed to customers on request

### Account Ownership

**Accounts Are Property of the Firm:** If a registered representative leaves a broker-dealer for any
reason, all accounts are considered to be the property of the firm. The broker-dealer will allocate
the departing representative's accounts among the existing representatives at that firm.

If a representative inherits an account (e.g., from a retiring representative or one who has left
the firm), the account documents must be **updated prior to making any transactions** in the
account.

### Transfer of Accounts Within the Firm

If a customer wishes to have their account transferred to another broker at the **same firm**, the
branch manager must approve. There is no requirement to complete another new account form. However,
**discretionary power cannot be transferred**—the client would need to provide written discretionary
authority to their new representative.

### Proxy Materials

To facilitate trading, the ownership of a security is usually registered in the name of the
broker-dealer. The purchaser is still the **beneficial owner** of the security, meaning they
maintain all the rights of ownership, including dividends and voting rights. This kind of
registration is called holding securities in **street name** (because many broker-dealers were
located on Wall Street).

A firm that holds securities in street name must **forward all information** it receives from the
issuer (such as annual reports) to the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner's investment
adviser.

The SEC requires companies to send shareholders a **proxy statement** prior to every stockholders'
meeting. Whenever an issuer delivers proxy materials to a firm and promises to reimburse the firm
for out-of-pocket expenses, the member firm must promptly send those materials to the beneficial
owner.

A proxy statement provides information relevant to upcoming votes, such as:

- The election of individuals to the board of directors
- The election or ratification of the company's accountant
- Authorization of new securities issues
- The modification or exchange of securities
- Any other submitted shareholder resolutions

## Senior Investor Protections

FINRA has stated that a customer's age and life stage are both important factors when determining
suitability. As investors age, their investment time horizons, goals, risk tolerance, and tax status
often change, and liquidity takes on added importance.

### Typically Unsuitable Recommendations for Seniors

FINRA has stated that it does not prohibit any particular recommendation to a senior citizen if it
is suitable. However, certain types of recommendations are **red flags**:

**RED FLAGS FOR SENIOR INVESTORS:**

- Purchase of **variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities, and real estate limited partnerships**
- Purchase of **variable life settlements**
- Purchase of **complex structured products** such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
- A recommendation to **mortgage their residence** to obtain funds for investment purposes
- A recommendation to use **retirement savings**, including early withdrawals from IRAs, to invest
  in **high-risk investments**

### Real-World Example: The Variable Annuity Scandal

Between 2000 and 2010, securities regulators sanctioned dozens of firms for selling unsuitable
variable annuities to seniors. The classic case: selling an 85-year-old a variable annuity with a
15-year surrender period and 7% surrender charges. If the customer needed the money before age 100
(likely, given life expectancy), they'd face massive penalties. Why did brokers sell them?
Commissions often exceeded 7% of the investment. FINRA cracked down hard, and several major firms
paid settlements exceeding $50 million each.

### Senior Certifications

FINRA is concerned about registered representatives using bogus certifications when making
presentations to senior citizens.

Claiming to be a:

- Certified Senior Adviser
- Certified Financial Gerontologist
- Senior Specialist
- Retirement Specialist

...is **prohibited** since these are not true professional designations.

If a representative has an **independently conferred designation** that requires rigorous training,
such as a **CFP (Certified Financial Planner)** or **CPA (Certified Public Accountant)**, these
designations can be used.

### Trusted Contact Person

FINRA requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name and contact information of a
**trusted contact person** when opening an account for a client.

#### Historical Context: Closing the Exploitation Gap

The trusted contact requirement (FINRA Rule 4512, effective February 2018) addresses a frustrating
gap that brokers faced for years. A representative would notice signs that an elderly client was
being exploited—perhaps by a caregiver or family member—but had no one to call. Privacy rules
prevented sharing account information with anyone except the customer. Meanwhile, the exploitation
continued.

The trusted contact person gives firms a lifeline: someone they can call to verify the customer's
wellbeing without violating privacy rules. It's not a power of attorney. It's more like an emergency
contact for your money.

The member must disclose in writing to the client that the firm or associated person will be
authorized to contact the trusted contact person to:

- Disclose information about the client's account to address possible financial exploitation
- Confirm the specifics of the client's current contact information or health status
- Obtain the identity of any legal guardian, executor, trustee, or holder of a power of attorney

### Diminished Mental Capacity

Firms must train their employees to identify diminished mental capacity. FINRA requires that firms
have an internal process to permit representatives to get advice from others as to what steps to
take.

**Document suspicions:** The representative should document the suspected diminished capacity and
escalate immediately. The firm should have a clearly designated individual to whom the matter is
directed.

Once the problem is identified and escalated, the next step for the firm is to **stop trading in the
account** until the concern no longer exists. Then the firm should:

- Communicate with the customer's designated emergency contact person (next of kin) or a person
  given power of attorney over the account to discuss the situation
- Maintain frequent contact with the investor to assess the situation and notify legal or compliance
  about these conversations
- Consult appropriate state statutes to determine the next steps, which may include alerting
  appropriate authorities, including government protective services

### Financial Exploitation of Senior Citizens

FINRA allows firms to place temporary holds on disbursements from client accounts when fraud is
suspected. The investors who FINRA believes are particularly susceptible to financial exploitation
are:

- Individuals aged **65 or older**; or
- Individuals aged **18 or older** where the member believes that the individual has a mental or
  physical impairment that makes the individual unable to protect their own interests

FINRA calls these vulnerable individuals **specified adults**.

If a rep suspects financial exploitation, the rep should immediately report this to the appropriate
person within the firm. The rep may also want to discuss their concerns directly with the customer.

### The 15-Business Day Hold

#### Historical Context: Creating a Safe Harbor

FINRA Rule 2165 (effective February 2018) solved a legal catch-22. Before this rule, if a broker
suspected a customer was being exploited and refused to process a suspicious disbursement, the
broker could be sued for breach of contract. But if they processed it and the money disappeared to a
scammer, they'd face regulatory scrutiny for failing to protect a vulnerable customer.

Rule 2165 created a "safe harbor"—firms can now place temporary holds on suspicious disbursements
without legal liability, giving them time to investigate. Every year, millions of seniors lose
billions of dollars to financial exploitation. This rule gives firms a tool to fight back.

**TEMPORARY HOLD TIMELINES:**

| Situation                                        | Hold Duration                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Initial hold for suspected fraud                 | **15 business days**                       |
| Extension if review supports exploitation belief | Additional **10 business days** (25 total) |
| If state or federal investigation begins         | Additional **30 days** (55 total)          |

Note that this hold only applies to **suspicious disbursements**, not to ones that are not
suspicious.

If a hold is put on the account, the member must document why it has done so and must notify the
**trusted contact person** named on the account, assuming the trusted contact person is not the
exploiter.

### Real-World Example: The Grandparent Scam

A common exploitation scheme: a scammer calls an elderly investor claiming to be their grandchild in
jail in Mexico, desperately needing $50,000 wired immediately. The panicked grandparent goes to
their broker to liquidate investments. A well-trained representative recognizes the classic
"grandparent scam" pattern and places a 15-business day hold while contacting the trusted contact
person. The trusted contact confirms that the grandchild is actually safe at home in Ohio. The hold
prevented a $50,000 loss. Before Rule 2165, the broker might have processed the request to avoid
potential liability—and the money would be gone forever.

### Why These Rules Matter

The regulations in this chapter aren't arbitrary bureaucracy—they're responses to real failures.
Every requirement for customer identification traces back to the USA PATRIOT Act's response to 9/11.
Every suitability rule exists because brokers once sold inappropriate products to unsuitable
customers. Every senior protection measure addresses documented cases of exploitation.

From Allen Stanford's $7 billion Ponzi scheme to Bernie Madoff's $64.5 billion fraud, from churning
scandals to auction rate securities, from the 1929 crash to 9/11—the rules exist because someone,
somewhere, found a way to exploit the system. And regulators responded.

Understanding the "why" behind these rules makes them easier to remember—and easier to apply when
you're actually working with customers in the securities industry. The paperwork isn't just
paperwork. It's protection. It's accountability. It's the difference between a functioning market
and chaos.
