# Joint, Business, and Options Accounts

## Introduction

On March 15, 1985, a husband and wife in New Jersey learned an expensive lesson about account
registration. The husband died, and his wife assumed she'd inherit their joint brokerage account
automatically. She was wrong. Their account was registered as "tenancy in common"—which meant his
half went to his estate, not to her. The probate process took eighteen months and cost $47,000 in
legal fees.

Two words on an account form. Eighteen months of headaches.

Account registration matters. Whether it's a married couple's joint account, a corporation's
investment holdings, or an individual's options trading account, the type of account determines the
paperwork required, the authority structure, and what happens when circumstances change.

This section covers the account types that fall outside the basic individual framework. They're less
common than individual accounts, but they appear frequently on the exam—and in practice, they often
involve the most complex client situations you'll encounter.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:

- Distinguish between JTWROS and tenancy in common
- Explain how Transfer on Death (TOD) registration works
- Identify required documentation for corporate and partnership accounts
- Understand investment adviser and prime brokerage accounts
- Describe the options account approval process
- Know the 15-day rule for options agreements

## Joint Accounts

When more than one person owns an account, things get more complicated.

All parties need to provide new account information. All parties can access the account and trade
independently. And here's one that catches people: **any check issued must be made payable to all
parties** on the account.

But the real question—the one that matters most—is what happens when one owner dies.

### Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS)

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">JTWROS - THE KEY FEATURES</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>JTWROS</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Ownership type</strong></td>
        <td>UNDIVIDED interest (not percentage-based)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>At death</strong></td>
        <td>Survivor becomes SOLE owner automatically</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Probate</strong></td>
        <td>AVOIDED — no court involvement</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Typical use</strong></td>
        <td>SPOUSES</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The name tells you what matters: <span class="key-term">rights of survivorship</span>. If one party
dies, the surviving owner automatically becomes sole owner. No lawyers. No court proceedings. No
delays.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Why Probate Matters</div>
  <p><span class="key-term">Probate</span> is the court process of validating a will and distributing assets. It's time-consuming (often months), expensive (legal fees), and public (anyone can see the details). JTWROS avoids all of that.</p>
</div>

### Tenancy in Common

Different structure, different outcome.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">TENANCY IN COMMON - THE KEY FEATURES</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Tenancy in Common</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Ownership type</strong></td>
        <td>PERCENTAGE-BASED (50/50, 60/40, etc.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>At death</strong></td>
        <td>Deceased's share goes to ESTATE (not survivor)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Probate</strong></td>
        <td>REQUIRED — must go through court</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Typical use</strong></td>
        <td>BUSINESS PARTNERS</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

This structure makes sense for business partners. If you're running a business with someone, you
might not want your investment account to automatically go to them when you die—you want it to go to
your heirs.

## Transfer on Death (TOD)

<span class="key-term">Transfer on death (TOD)</span> isn't an account type—it's a registration
option.

With a TOD designation:

- The account owner maintains **full control** during their lifetime
- At death, the account transfers directly to the named <span class="key-term">beneficiary</span>
- Like JTWROS, it **avoids probate**

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">TOD vs. JTWROS</div>
  <p>Think of TOD as a way to get the probate-avoidance benefit of JTWROS without actually sharing ownership while you're alive. The owner keeps full control until death.</p>
</div>

## Business Accounts

### Corporate Accounts

Corporations are legal entities separate from their owners. To open a corporate account:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">CORPORATE ACCOUNT REQUIREMENTS</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Required Document</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Corporate resolution</strong></td>
        <td>Authorizes account opening; names who can trade</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Tax ID number</strong></td>
        <td>Corporate tax identification</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Corporate charter</strong></td>
        <td>Often required by firm</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The <span class="key-term">corporate resolution</span> is the key document. It proves the
corporation authorized the account and identifies who has trading authority.

### Partnership Accounts

Partnerships require the <span class="key-term">partnership agreement</span>, which must:

- Authorize opening the account
- Name the partners who can trade

Like a corporate resolution, the partnership agreement is the source of authority. No agreement? No
account.

### Investment Adviser Accounts

An <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span> manages money for clients in exchange for a fee.
They're <span class="key-term">fiduciaries</span>—legally required to put clients' interests first.

Investment adviser accounts typically work like this:

- Account held in the **client's name**
- Adviser has <span class="key-term">discretionary authority</span> to trade
- Adviser makes most decisions without calling the client first

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Omnibus Accounts</div>
  <p>When an adviser has many clients, they might open an <span class="key-term">omnibus account</span>—a single account in the adviser's name holding all clients' securities. The adviser keeps internal records of who owns what. Opening requires individual new account forms for each client, plus third-party trading authorization.</p>
</div>

### Prime Brokerage Accounts

Hedge funds and institutions often trade through multiple broker-dealers called
<span class="key-term">executing brokers</span>. A <span class="key-term">prime broker</span>
centralizes:

- Settlement of trades from all executing brokers
- Custody of assets
- Reporting and record-keeping
- Protection of the institution's trading strategy

Prime brokerage is an institutional service. Individual investors don't use it.

### Wrap Accounts

A <span class="key-term">wrap account</span> bundles everything—management, trading, custody,
administration—into a single fee.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">WRAP ACCOUNT FEATURES</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Fee structure</strong></td>
        <td>Single fee based on AUM (typically 1-3% annually)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Commissions</strong></td>
        <td>NO separate trade commissions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Registration required</strong></td>
        <td>BOTH broker-dealer rep AND investment adviser rep</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The appeal for clients: simplicity and aligned incentives. The adviser doesn't make more money by
trading more.

## Options Accounts

Options are different. More complex. More risky. And therefore, more regulated.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) opened in 1973, creating the first standardized, exchange-traded options market. Before that, options were bespoke contracts traded between institutions. The Cboe brought options to retail investors—and with that access came the need for suitability standards and approval processes that didn't exist for regular stock trading.</p>
</div>

The <span class="key-term">Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe)</span> and the
<span class="key-term">Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)</span> impose specific requirements beyond
standard FINRA rules.

### Opening Requirements

To open an options account, the customer must provide information about:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">OPTIONS ACCOUNT INFORMATION REQUIRED</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Investment objective</li>
    <li>Investment experience</li>
    <li>Financial situation</li>
    <li>Financial needs</li>
    <li>Marital status</li>
    <li>Net worth</li>
    <li>Liquid net worth</li>
    <li>Estimated annual income</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> If a customer refuses to disclose required information, the registered representative must note "not disclosed" for each item. The approving manager then decides whether to open the account anyway. Limited information typically means limited approval—or no approval.</p>
</div>

### The Options Agreement

Cboe requires the customer receive a copy of the <span class="key-term">options agreement</span>
before trading. By signing, the customer agrees to:

- Abide by any trading restrictions the firm imposes
- Follow OCC rules (position limits, exercise limits)
- Update the firm if their financial situation changes materially

### The Approval Process

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">OPTIONS APPROVAL SEQUENCE</div>
  <table class="comparison-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Step</th>
        <th>Who</th>
        <th>Action</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Registered Rep</td>
        <td>Signs new account form, verifying information is accurate</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Firm</td>
        <td>Completes suitability assessment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td><strong>Registered Options Principal</strong></td>
        <td>Provides FINAL written approval</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="exam-focus">
  <div class="exam-focus__label">IMPORTANT DISTINCTION</div>
  <p>A FINRA-registered <span class="key-term">branch office manager</span> can provide INITIAL approval for an options account. However, <strong>ultimate approval must come from a registered options principal</strong>.</p>
</div>

### The Options Disclosure Document (ODD)

Before or at the time of approval, the customer must receive the <span class="key-term">options
disclosure document (ODD)</span>, created by the OCC. This document explains the risks of options
trading.

**Timing**: The ODD must be delivered by the date of the principal's approval—not later.

### The 15-Day Rule

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">THE 15-DAY CLOCK</div>
  <p>Once the account is approved, the customer can begin trading. But if the customer <strong>fails to return the signed options agreement within 15 days</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They <strong>CANNOT</strong> open any new positions</li>
    <li>They <strong>CAN</strong> close existing positions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the signed agreement arrives later, the restriction lifts.</p>
</div>

### Options Accounts for Associated Persons

What if a registered representative at one firm wants to open an options account at a different
firm?

They need **written approval from their employer** first.

If approved, all statements and confirmations will be **automatically sent to the employing
broker-dealer**. This prevents representatives from hiding trading activity from their compliance
departments.

## Test Preparation

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> For joint accounts, remember: JTWROS = survivor takes all, avoids probate (think SPOUSES). Tenancy in common = percentage interest, goes to estate (think BUSINESS PARTNERS).</p>
</div>

### Key Points to Remember

1. **JTWROS vs. Tenancy in Common** — survivor vs. estate; probate avoided vs. required
2. **TOD** — avoids probate like JTWROS but owner keeps full control until death
3. **Corporate accounts** — need corporate resolution naming authorized traders
4. **Options accounts** — final approval from registered options principal
5. **15-day rule** — no new positions if signed agreement not returned

### Practice Questions Preview

- Scenarios comparing JTWROS and tenancy in common outcomes
- Questions about required documentation for business accounts
- Options account approval sequence questions
- 15-day rule application scenarios

## Summary

Account registration determines authority, documentation requirements, and outcomes when
circumstances change. Joint accounts pass differently depending on whether they're JTWROS (survivor
takes all) or tenancy in common (estate inherits). Business accounts require specific authorization
documents. Options accounts need additional approval steps and disclosures.

The details matter. Two words on an account form—"rights of survivorship" or "tenancy in common"—can
mean the difference between a seamless transfer and eighteen months of probate.
