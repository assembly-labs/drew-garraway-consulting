# Distributions and Prohibited Practices

## Introduction

Mutual funds enjoy a significant tax advantage—if they follow the rules. Subchapter M of the IRS
Code allows funds to avoid corporate-level taxation on income they distribute to shareholders.

But with this privilege comes responsibility. The securities industry has clear rules about what
constitutes ethical fund sales, and violations carry serious consequences.

This section covers both topics: how fund distributions work, and what practices will end your
career.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:

- Explain Subchapter M and its 90% distribution requirement
- Identify prohibited mutual fund sales practices
- Understand why "selling dividends" harms investors
- Recognize breakpoint sales violations

## Fund Distributions Under Subchapter M

  <div class="exam-focus__label">BORDERLINE TOPIC - STRENGTHEN THIS</div>
  <p>You scored borderline on Subchapter M. Focus on the 90% rule and the tax implications.</p>
</div>

Here's a tax advantage that makes mutual funds viable: <span class="key-term">Subchapter M</span> of
the IRS Code.

    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>EXAM TRAP:</strong> Shareholders pay taxes on distributions even if REINVESTED. Reinvestment doesn't defer taxes!</p>
</div>

### The 90% Rule

If a fund distributes at least **90% of its net investment income** to shareholders, the fund itself
doesn't pay tax on that income. This avoids the "double taxation" problem where a corporation pays
tax on income, then shareholders pay again on dividends.

| Distribution Level        | Tax Treatment                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Distributes 90%+          | Fund pays no tax on distributed income     |
| Distributes less than 90% | Fund pays corporate tax on retained income |

### The Catch

**You** pay taxes on the distributions, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them. Reinvested
dividends are still taxable in the year received.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Why This Matters</div>
  <p>Many investors are surprised to receive a tax bill for dividends they never saw—because they were automatically reinvested. The tax liability exists regardless of whether you take the cash.</p>
</div>

## Ex-Dividend Dates

Understanding ex-dividend dates helps explain some prohibited practices:

| Fund Type           | Ex-Dividend Date Set By                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Closed-End Fund** | Exchange/FINRA                                        |
| **Open-End Fund**   | Fund's Board of Directors (usually day AFTER payment) |

---

## Capital Gains Distributions

Funds distribute capital gains annually. Net losses are NOT distributed—they're carried forward by
the fund.

### Cost Basis

Your <span class="key-term">cost basis</span> for tax purposes is:

- Original purchase price
- PLUS all reinvested distributions

This matters when you eventually sell. If you've been reinvesting dividends for 20 years, your cost
basis is much higher than your original investment—which reduces your taxable gain.

## Prohibited Sales Practices

The securities industry has rules, and breaking them has consequences. These four practices will get
you in serious trouble.

### 1. Breakpoint Sales

<span class="key-term">Breakpoint sales</span> are **PROHIBITED**.

**What it is**: Selling shares just below a breakpoint to avoid giving the customer a discount.

**Example**: A customer wants to invest $10,000. The breakpoint for reduced sales charges is
$10,001. Recommending they invest $9,999 to avoid the breakpoint? That's a violation.

**Also prohibited**: Spreading purchases across different fund families to prevent reaching
breakpoints within any single family.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Registered representatives must inform customers about breakpoints for large purchases. Failure to disclose is a violation.</p>
</div>

---

### 2. Churning

<span class="key-term">Churning</span> is **PROHIBITED**.

**What it is**: Recommending unnecessary trades to generate sales charges.

**Example**: Recommending a client sell Fund A to buy Fund B when both funds are essentially
identical in objective and holdings—just to generate a new sales charge.

Mutual funds aren't meant to be traded frequently. The sales charge structure discourages this, but
unethical representatives sometimes ignore that.

---

### 3. Inappropriate Class B Share Recommendations

Recommending Class B shares when Class A would be more appropriate is **PROHIBITED**.

**Why it happens**: Class B shares have no up-front charge, which sounds appealing to customers.
But:

- Higher ongoing 12b-1 fees cost more over time
- Large investments miss out on Class A breakpoints
- The CDSC traps investors if circumstances change

**Example**: A client wants to invest $100,000 for 20 years. Class A with breakpoint discounts is
clearly more appropriate than Class B with no breakpoints and higher ongoing fees.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">The Rule</div>
  <p>Large buyers should generally be placed in Class A since the sales charge may be reduced by breakpoints. Recommending Class B for large, long-term investments is a suitability violation.</p>
</div>

---

### 4. Selling Dividends

<span class="key-term">Selling dividends</span> is **PROHIBITED**.

**What it is**: Encouraging a customer to buy shares right before a dividend distribution.

**Why it's harmful**: The day after a dividend, the NAV drops by exactly the dividend amount. The
customer hasn't gained anything—they just converted NAV into a taxable dividend.

**Example**:

- Fund NAV: $20.00
- Tomorrow's dividend: $1.00
- NAV after dividend: $19.00

The customer has $19.00 in shares plus $1.00 in taxable income. They're not richer—but they do owe
taxes.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> "Selling dividends" is a popular exam topic. Remember: buying before a dividend creates a tax liability without creating any actual gain.</p>
</div>

---

## Test Preparation

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Know all four prohibited practices and be able to identify them in scenarios. The exam frequently presents situations where you must recognize the violation.</p>
</div>

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Subchapter M**: 90% distribution requirement to avoid fund-level taxation
2. **Breakpoint sales**: Never sell just below a breakpoint
3. **Churning**: Never recommend unnecessary trades for commissions
4. **Class B inappropriateness**: Large, long-term investors should be in Class A
5. **Selling dividends**: Never encourage buying right before ex-dividend date

### The Four Prohibited Practices Summary

| Practice                  | What It Is                         | Why It's Harmful                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Breakpoint Sales**      | Selling below breakpoint threshold | Customer pays higher sales charge  |
| **Churning**              | Excessive trading                  | Unnecessary sales charges          |
| **Inappropriate Class B** | Wrong share class for situation    | Higher costs than necessary        |
| **Selling Dividends**     | Buying before dividend             | Creates tax liability without gain |

## Summary

Subchapter M allows mutual funds to avoid corporate taxation by distributing at least 90% of net
investment income to shareholders. Shareholders then pay taxes on those distributions.

Four sales practices are strictly prohibited: breakpoint sales, churning, inappropriate Class B
recommendations, and selling dividends. Each harms investors while potentially benefiting unethical
representatives. Violations result in regulatory action, fines, and career consequences.
