# Retirement Plans

## Introduction

In 1875, the American Express Company created the first private pension plan in the United States. The idea was revolutionary: instead of working until you dropped, employees could actually stop working someday and still have income. It took another century before Congress passed ERISA in 1974, finally protecting workers from employers who promised pensions but never funded them.

Today, retirement planning has shifted dramatically. The old promise of "work here for 40 years and we'll take care of you" has largely given way to "here's a 401(k)—good luck." Understanding how these plans work isn't just exam material; it's the difference between retiring comfortably and greeting customers at big-box stores well into your seventies.

Most of us would like to stop working at some point in our lives, preferably as soon as possible. In order to do this, we need to have saved a sufficient amount of money to live. To achieve this goal, many people rely on a formal financial <span class="key-term">retirement plan</span>. A financial retirement plan is a formal way for working people to systematically save and invest money for retirement.

At the heart of most retirement plans are two goals:

1. To provide enough income to live on in retirement, including funds to meet other goals, such as travel, as well as emergency expenses.
2. To defer taxes until after retirement; the conventional wisdom is that the participant will then be in a lower tax bracket.

## Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans

A <span class="key-term">qualified retirement plan</span> is one that satisfies the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). ERISA covers retirement plans offered by for-profit employers. Qualified employer-sponsored retirement plans come in two types: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. <span class="key-term">Nonqualified plans</span> would include Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and deferred compensation plans.

<div class="historical-note">
<div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
<p>Before ERISA, employees had almost no protection. Companies could promise pensions, underfund them for decades, then declare bankruptcy—leaving retirees with nothing. The Studebaker Corporation collapse in 1963, which left 4,000 workers without promised pensions, became the catalyst for reform. ERISA created minimum funding standards, fiduciary duties, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure defined benefit plans.</p>
</div>

### ERISA Requirements

ERISA requirements include:

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">ERISA CORE REQUIREMENTS</div>

**Nondiscrimination**: All employees must be treated equally under the Act. These plans must be available to all eligible employees and not just highly paid executives.

**Eligibility**: Employers must offer their established plan to any employee who works more than 1,000 hours per year and has been with the company for more than 12 months.

**Vesting**: Employees must earn their employer contributions over a reasonable time period. Once the contributions are fully vested, the account is the property of the employee, even upon leaving the firm. There are two vesting schedules:
- **Cliff vesting**: Employees are 100% vested after three years
- **Graded vesting**: Employer contributions vest at 20% per year of service after the first year, with 100% vesting after six years

**Fiduciary responsibility**: The plan trustee must manage the assets of the plan in the best interests of all participants. Plan assets must be segregated from other company assets.
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Employees are always 100% vested in their own contributions. Only employer contributions are subject to vesting schedules.</p>
</div>

ERISA covers plans offered by for-profit companies. It does not cover public retirement plans for not-for-profit entities or U.S. government employees or state employees. These plans are exempt from ERISA requirements.

### Defined Benefit Plans

A <span class="key-term">defined benefit plan</span> is a qualified plan where the employer promises to pay each eligible employee a specific periodic (usually monthly) benefit for life, starting at retirement. A defined benefit plan, also called a <span class="key-term">pension plan</span>, is typically funded and managed by the employer. This means the investment decisions are made by the employer, and it is the employer's responsibility to make sure that enough money is set aside for its employees' retirement.

### Defined Contribution Plans

A <span class="key-term">defined contribution plan</span> is a retirement plan in which the employee determines the level of their contribution. Participants have their own individual accounts and choose from several different investment options. Benefits will depend on total contributions and investment returns.

In this kind of plan, participants typically contribute a portion of their earnings on a pre-tax basis. Often, employers will match a part of the employee's contributions. In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are assumed by the participant rather than by the employer. The contributions and earnings grow on a tax-deferred basis until they are withdrawn, at which time they will be taxed as ordinary income. Contribution limits are set annually by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Some plans may allow participants aged 50 and above to make additional <span class="key-term">catch-up contributions</span>.

Defined contribution plan benefits may be paid out in a lump sum or in installments, or as an annuity over the employee's lifetime.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">TYPES OF DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS</div>

**401(k) Plan**: The most common type—a plan for corporate employees in which employees contribute a portion of their wages to individual accounts and where contributions may be matched by their employer.

**Profit-Sharing Plans**: Enable employers to contribute to employee accounts based on corporate profits. Contributions are not guaranteed and may be skipped in years in which the corporation is not profitable.

**403(b) Plans**: Also called tax-sheltered annuities, these are similar to 401(k) plans but for employees of nonprofit entities. These employers would include public schools and 501(c)(3) entities such as charities and religious organizations. The plans are exempt from ERISA requirements, but often choose to follow them.
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Employees who participate in work-sponsored retirement plans are still able to contribute to an IRA. These contributions may or may not be tax deductible depending on income level.</p>
</div>

### Withdrawing Funds from Defined Contribution Plans

While individuals can withdraw funds at any time from their defined contribution account, they will be taxed and receive an additional <strong>10% tax penalty</strong> on any withdrawals made before the age of 59½.

The early withdrawal penalty can be avoided if the withdrawal is for any of the following reasons:
- The payment of medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of the individual's gross income
- Death or permanent disability
- The withdrawals occur in five substantially equal periodic payments
- The distribution is made to an employee after separation from service, as long as the separation occurred during or after the calendar year in which the employee reached age 55
- A person who has a child (including by adoption) can withdraw up to $5,000 from their 401(k) or IRA without penalty. This benefit must be used within one year of the date of birth or adoption, and the $5,000 limit applies separately to each parent.

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Sales and purchases of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and any other securities within retirement accounts are not subject to taxation. Income is only taxed when funds are withdrawn from the account and are taxed as ordinary income—never as capital gains.</p>
</div>

</div>

### Nonqualified Retirement Plans

<span class="key-term">Nonqualified retirement plans</span> are not covered by ERISA. Since the discrimination rules do not apply, these plans are often used to give special retirement benefits to key employees. A common type of nonqualified plan is a <span class="key-term">deferred compensation plan</span>. These plans are designed to attract "key" employees. Under this plan type, portions of income are deferred until retirement or death. Corporate contributions to these plans are not deductible.

A <span class="key-term">457 plan</span> is a tax-advantaged plan similar to a 401(k) plan for state and local government employees. Government plans are exempt from ERISA requirements, and as such, they are nonqualified plans. Nonprofit 403(b) plans are also nonqualified plans.

## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

Under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules, individuals can set up <span class="key-term">individual retirement accounts (IRAs)</span> to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. (You might also see IRAs referred to as <span class="key-term">individual retirement arrangements</span>, terminology often used by the IRS.) Depending on income and availability of a workplace retirement plan, certain individuals may deduct their contributions. At withdrawal, all deductible (pre-tax) contributions and earnings are taxed at the individual's ordinary tax rate. Nondeductible (after-tax) contributions are tax-free. To distinguish from Roth IRAs, these accounts are often referred to as <span class="key-term">traditional IRAs</span>.

### Contributing to an IRA

The government puts limits on IRA contributions. All contributions must be made only from <span class="key-term">earned income</span>, as opposed to passive income. Earned income typically means wages.

<span class="key-term">Unearned income</span> includes:
- Dividends, capital gains, and interest on securities
- Social security benefits
- Unemployment benefits
- Child support
- Rental income
- Inherited funds

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box__title">Contribution Limits</div>
<p>Traditional IRA contributions are limited to earned income. Portfolio income, inheritance, alimony and other forms of income cannot be invested in an IRA. Persons aged 50 or above may contribute an extra $1,000 annually as a catch-up contribution.</p>
<p>In addition, a nonworking spouse can set up a separate IRA and their working spouse can contribute up to the maximum on their behalf with their earned income (with their own catch-up contribution if aged 50 or above).</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> There is no such thing as a joint IRA. IRAs are for individuals and must be separate accounts.</p>
</div>

### Contributing to More Than One Retirement Plan

If an individual is participating in another qualified retirement plan, such as a 401(k), they can open an IRA and make contributions up to the limit, but their contributions may not be tax deductible. The deduction amount will depend on the individual's income level.

### Suitable Investments for an IRA

Only cash or cash equivalents can be deposited into an IRA. But once in the account, the funds can generally be used to buy securities. IRAs can be used to buy real estate.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">IRA INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS</div>

**Prohibited in IRAs:**
- Collectibles (works of art, stamps, etc.)
- Life insurance
- Naked (uncovered) calls

**Permitted in IRAs:**
- Covered calls
- Protective puts
- Municipal bonds (though typically not suitable due to tax-deferred nature)
</div>

### Withdrawing Funds from a Traditional IRA

Most individuals will make pre-tax contributions to their traditional IRA. Any after-tax contributions can be withdrawn tax-free, but the individual must show evidence that taxes were paid on these contributions.

While individuals can withdraw funds at any time from their accounts, if they make withdrawals before the age of 59½, they will be taxed on both their pre-tax contributions and their earnings and face an additional <strong>10% tax penalty</strong>.

Individuals can avoid the 10% tax penalty if the withdrawal is for one of the following reasons:
- Qualified education expenses (tuition, books, supplies)
- Payment of medical expenses (if more than 7.5% of adjusted gross income)
- Permanent disability
- First-time home purchase ($10,000 lifetime maximum)
- Payment of health insurance premiums by unemployed or self-employed person who has received state or federal aid for three months straight
- The withdrawals occur in substantially equal periodic payments (IRS Rule 72(t)) continuously for five years
- Birth or adoption of a child (up to $5,000 per parent, within one year)

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

The first distribution from the plan must be taken no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which the participant turns 73. After that, distributions must occur no later than December 31 each year. The amount of the withdrawal is calculated by the IRS.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">RMD PENALTY</div>
<p>If distributions fall short of the RMDs, a penalty tax of <strong>25%</strong> is applied to the amount not distributed. There are no RMD requirements for Roth IRAs.</p>
</div>

### Retirement Plan Transfer vs. Rollover

A person can <span class="key-term">transfer</span> their IRA directly into another IRA at a different bank or broker-dealer. If the individual is leaving a company, retirement plan assets can also be directly transferred into a conduit IRA. When assets are transferred directly from one account to another, there is no tax liability. The number of transfers that can be made is unlimited. Transfers may be referred to as <span class="key-term">direct rollovers</span>.

Another method of transferring retirement assets is a <span class="key-term">rollover</span>. In this case, a check is sent directly to the participant and 20% of the rollover will be withheld. The money must be redeposited within 60 days of the distribution date, or the entire amount will be taxable and possibly subject to early withdrawal penalties. Rollovers can only occur once per year.

### Roth IRAs

Unlike traditional IRAs, <span class="key-term">Roth IRA</span> contributions are never tax deductible. In other words, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars. However, if the account has been held for five years or more, and the individual is at least age 59½, earnings may be withdrawn tax-free and penalty-free.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">ROTH IRA RULES</div>

- Contributions are never tax deductible
- Contributions are limited to earned income
- Contribution limits are the same as traditional IRAs
- Contributions can be withdrawn tax-free without penalty at any time
- Participants with income over certain levels (high-earners) are not eligible to contribute
- There are no required minimum distributions
</div>

Individuals may contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA but cannot contribute more than the annual maximum combined across both accounts.
