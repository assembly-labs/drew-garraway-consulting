# Variable Annuities

## Introduction

In 1952, TIAA-CREF created the first variable annuity for college professors worried that their fixed pensions wouldn't keep pace with inflation. The concept was revolutionary: instead of a guaranteed fixed payment, retirement income would rise and fall with the stock market. Professors were essentially betting that equities would outperform bonds over the long term. Seven decades later, that bet has generally paid off—but the complexity of modern variable annuities would make those 1950s academics' heads spin.

Variable annuities now come with surrender charges, mortality and expense fees, subaccount options, guaranteed minimum death benefits, and more riders than a motorcycle gang. Understanding these products is essential because they sit at the intersection of insurance and securities regulation—and because unsuitable annuity sales remain one of FINRA's top enforcement priorities.

<span class="key-term">Annuities</span> are investment vehicles that provide tax-deferred growth. They can also be used to provide income to an individual during retirement.

## Annuity Basics

An <span class="key-term">annuity</span> is an investment contract between an individual and an insurance company. As part of the contract, the owner invests money with the insurance company, either as a lump sum or in periodic payments. When the owner reaches retirement age, the insurance company will begin distributing payments. Payments may be made monthly, in a lump sum, or randomly, based on the wishes of the contract owner. The size of the payments depends on the amount deposited and any accumulated growth.

There are two types of annuities: <span class="key-term">fixed annuities</span> and <span class="key-term">variable annuities</span>.

### Fixed Annuity: Guaranteed Rate of Return

In a fixed annuity contract, the insurer guarantees a specific rate of return to the investor. No matter how good or bad the investments funding the annuity perform, the investor earns the same guaranteed rate of return.

The insurance company invests the customer's <span class="key-term">annuity premiums</span> into the company's <span class="key-term">general account</span>. The insurance company chooses the investments and assumes the investment risk, so a fixed annuity is not considered to be a security—it is an insurance product regulated by insurance laws only.

<span class="key-term">Indexed annuities</span> are a type of fixed annuity that tracks an index and pays a rate of return based on the performance of that index. These are also considered to be fixed annuities and not subject to securities laws.

At retirement, the owner may choose to <span class="key-term">annuitize</span> the contract and begin receiving periodic payments. Because insurance companies tend to invest conservatively in fixed income securities, fixed annuities usually have a lower rate of return. Moreover, the payments are typically fixed and are not adjusted for inflation. This means that the annuitant is subject to <span class="key-term">purchasing power risk</span>, also called <span class="key-term">inflation risk</span>—the risk that future fixed payments will be worth less in real dollar terms.

### Variable Annuity: No Guaranteed Rate of Return

In a variable annuity contract, there is no guarantee of a specific rate of return. Customers are given a menu of mutual fund-like investments to choose from. If the investments perform better than expected, the annuity value increases. If the investments funding the annuity perform worse than expected, the annuity value decreases. Hence the name variable annuity.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">KEY DISTINCTION</div>
<p>Since the investor selects the investment vehicles to be used, <strong>variable annuities are considered to be securities</strong> that are regulated under securities laws. Unlike fixed annuities, variable annuities must be sold under a prospectus.</p>
<p>Individuals who sell any type of annuity must be state registered to sell insurance products. Sellers of variable insurance products must also be registered to sell securities (i.e., Series 6 or Series 7).</p>
</div>

## Variable Annuity Phases

Funds from variable annuities are kept in accounts that are separate from the insurance company's general account and are often referred to as <span class="key-term">separate accounts</span>. Within a separate account, the investor chooses from several possible <span class="key-term">subaccounts</span> that operate like mutual funds. For variable annuities, the investor, rather than the insurance company, bears the investment risk.

A variable annuity has two phases:

### Accumulation Phase

In the first phase, the customer contributes money to the annuity account and purchases a variable number of <span class="key-term">accumulation units</span>. As the customer contributes more, they will purchase more accumulation units. The units will grow (or shrink) in value depending on the performance of the separate subaccount investments chosen.

### Distribution Phase

Customers will typically wait until reaching retirement age to begin receiving distributions from their annuity. These distributions may come in a lump sum, or in the form of random withdrawals. Customers may choose to <span class="key-term">annuitize</span> the contract.

If the customer chooses annuitization, they become an <span class="key-term">annuitant</span> and will be promised a series of payments over a period of time, or for the rest of their life. The accumulation units will be converted into a fixed number of <span class="key-term">annuity units</span> based on the life expectancy of the annuitant. The monthly payments will depend on:
- The performance of the investments in the customer's separate account
- The age and sex of the customer
- The customer's choice of payment option

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box__title">Tax Treatment</div>
<p>Typically, a customer makes contributions to a variable annuity with after-tax dollars. Taxes on income earned in the annuity are deferred until the money is withdrawn. There is a 10% penalty on the earnings portion of withdrawals made before the age of 59½. Once earnings are withdrawn, they are taxed at the customer's ordinary income tax rate.</p>
</div>

Variable annuities are considered to be both an insurance product and a security and are subject to the regulations of both industries. On the security side, variable annuities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), as well as by each state.

## Characteristics of Variable Annuities

### Death Benefit

If the annuitant dies during the accumulation period, before the insurance company has begun payments, a beneficiary will receive a payment. This is called a <span class="key-term">death benefit</span>. The payment the beneficiary receives will equal the total investments and any additional earnings from the annuity. If the annuity lost money, the beneficiary will receive the total invested money. The beneficiary is responsible for paying income taxes on any earnings.

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box__title">Death Benefit vs. Period Certain</div>
<p>In some cases, an annuitant may choose to annuitize a contract and receive payments for a certain period (e.g., 20 years). If the annuitant dies during this period, the named beneficiary will continue to receive the annuity payments. This situation is not considered a death benefit—it's part of the payout option selected.</p>
</div>

### Purchasing Annuities

Annuitants may purchase an annuity in one of three ways:

</div>

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> There is no periodic payment immediate annuity. Think about it—if you're making periodic payments, you can't also be receiving immediate payouts.</p>
</div>

### Deferred Annuity Surrender Periods

With a deferred annuity, the annuitant may not withdraw funds for up to 10 years without penalty. The length of time that the investor must wait before withdrawing money from the annuity without penalty is called the <span class="key-term">surrender period</span>. If the annuitant needs the money before the end of the surrender period, they can surrender the contract by paying a <span class="key-term">surrender fee</span>. The <span class="key-term">surrender value</span> of the account will be the value in the account at the time of surrender minus the surrender fee.

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Customers who need income in the near future, such as the elderly, should not consider deferred annuities. This is a key suitability consideration.</p>
</div>

### Free-Look Period

Variable annuities typically have a <span class="key-term">free-look period</span>, which allows customers to cancel the policy within a certain period of time at no charge. The amount of time for the free look may be 10 days or more, depending on state law.

### Receiving Payment

At a certain point, the investor will decide to end the accumulation phase and move into the payout phase. During the payout phase, the investor can choose to receive payment in one of the following ways:
- Lump sum
- Monthly payments (annuitize the contract)
- Random withdrawal—the annuitant chooses to take random sums over random periods of time

### Annuity Payout Options (Settlement Options)

If the owner chooses to annuitize the contract, they must select a method of receiving payments. The choice of payout option will determine the amount of the monthly check the annuitant will receive.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">PAYOUT OPTIONS</div>

**Life Income**: The insurer pays the annuitant for the remainder of their lifetime. When the annuitant dies, benefits stop. This option is likely to be the shortest period, and so will be the least expensive for the insurance company. The annuitant will receive the <strong>largest monthly check</strong>.

**Life with Period Certain**: The insurer pays the annuitant an income during their lifetime. But if the annuitant dies before the period certain expires, payments will continue to be made to a beneficiary. The annuitant will receive <strong>medium-sized monthly checks</strong>.

**Joint Life with Last Survivor**: This option covers two lifetimes. The insurer will continue paying a benefit until both covered parties have died. This option is typically chosen by a married couple. This option will have the <strong>smallest monthly checks</strong> because payments continue through both lives.
</div>

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box__title">Example: Life with Period Certain</div>
<p>The annuitant chooses life with a period certain of 20 years. The annuitant will receive a payment for life, but if they die during the next 20 years, the named beneficiary will receive payments for the remainder of the 20-year period.</p>

## Variable Annuity Rules and Regulations

### Federal Regulations Regarding Variable Annuities

Under the Securities Act of 1933, variable annuities are considered to be securities and, therefore, need to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must always be sold with a prospectus. These securities are also subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, variable annuities may only be sold by a registered broker-dealer and their registered representatives. The broker-dealer must be a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

As a separate business entity, variable annuities must keep the invested premiums in a separate account from the insurance company's fixed annuity and other insurance accounts. Securities can only be bought and sold within this separate account.

### Recommending Deferred Variable Annuities

When recommending a deferred variable annuity to a customer, a registered rep must describe the annuity's specific features:

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">REQUIRED DISCLOSURES</div>

- Potential surrender period and surrender charge
- Potential tax penalty if customers make withdrawals before reaching the age of 59½
- The various costs and fees (variable annuities have higher fees than regular mutual fund investments)
- Variable annuities are subject to market risk
</div>

A registered rep must have a reasonable basis to believe that a customer would benefit from the annuity's features, such as tax-deferred growth and a death benefit. The registered rep must determine the suitability of a deferred annuity, taking into consideration surrender periods and charges, additional fees, and whether there have been any contract exchanges within the last three years.

A registered principal must approve a customer's application for a deferred annuity before it is sent to the insurance company. A customer's suitability must be considered. Approval (or not) must occur within <strong>seven business days</strong> of receiving the application.

### Suitability

When recommending a fixed annuity versus a variable annuity, a representative needs to know the customer's risk tolerance. A fixed annuity is suitable for a risk-averse investor who is seeking guaranteed fixed payments for life. A variable annuity is for those who are willing to take on investment risk in return for the possibility of higher earnings.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">SUITABILITY FACTORS</div>

- Annuities with long surrender periods should not be sold to elderly customers, who may need to withdraw their money before the surrender period is over
- Annuities may be appropriate for customers who want to be assured of a death benefit
- Customers who need money in the near future should consider only an immediate annuity, not a deferred annuity
- Annuities enjoy tax-deferred growth, so they may be suitable for individuals in a high tax bracket
- Unlike contributions to IRAs and 401(k)s, contributions to most annuities are not tax deductible
- Generally, a customer should first have reached the maximum amount that can be put into their IRA or 401(k) before investing in an annuity
- Because the earnings in an annuity grow tax-deferred, there is no extra tax benefit from holding an annuity inside an IRA or a 401(k)
</div>

### Taxation

In a <span class="key-term">nonqualified annuity</span>, contributions are made on an after-tax basis. Earnings from nonqualified variable annuities are taxed as ordinary income. If the owner chooses to annuitize the contract, each annuity payment will be divided between an earnings portion that is taxed as ordinary income and the remainder (contributions) as a tax-free return of capital.

In a <span class="key-term">qualified annuity</span> (e.g., a 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity), contributions are made on a pre-tax basis. As a result, all withdrawals are fully taxable as ordinary income.

<div class="test-tip">
<p><strong>Test-Taking Tip:</strong> Withdrawals from any retirement plan or variable insurance product are never subject to capital gains taxes but are only treated as ordinary income.</p>
</div>

---

## Variable Life Insurance Contracts

Another insurance product that is also considered a security is <span class="key-term">variable life insurance</span>. As with variable annuities, the premiums paid for insurance coverage are deposited by the insurance company into a separate account. The growth in the separate account's value determines the death benefit that will be paid—so the insurance coverage amount will vary with the performance of the separate account.

### Variable Life Is a Security

Variable life insurance policies require that a customer be provided with a prospectus. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) views a variable life policy as a security because investment risk is borne by the purchaser and not the insurance company.

### Permanent Insurance

Variable life insurance is known as <span class="key-term">permanent insurance</span>, meaning that as long as the premium is paid, the policy stays in force. Part of the premium pays for the cost of insurance and the balance is invested in the separate account. The premium payment amount is fixed—it does not change. What does vary is the death benefit and the policy's <span class="key-term">cash value</span>. Cash value is the amount that can be borrowed against the policy or withdrawn if the policy is surrendered.

### Charges and Fees

Costs associated with variable life policies are deducted from premiums and may include:

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">VARIABLE LIFE FEES</div>

- **Mortality and expense risk charges**: The cost of the death benefit (the life insurance component)
- **Sales fees**: To pay the agent's commission cost
- **Administrative fees**: To cover the insurer's ongoing expenses
- **State premium fees**: Insurance companies are state-regulated, and states often impose a premium tax
- **Investment management fees**: The fees charged for running the mutual funds held in the separate account
- **Rider fees**: The cost of optional additional benefits that alter the terms of the policy. The most typical is a guaranteed minimum death benefit, which promises to grow the separate account at a minimum guaranteed rate
</div>

## Summary & Key Points

Variable annuities sit at the crossroads of insurance and securities—offering tax-deferred growth with investment flexibility, but also carrying fees, surrender charges, and complexity that make suitability a paramount concern. The key to understanding these products is recognizing who bears the investment risk and how that determines regulatory treatment.
