# Municipal Fund Securities

## Introduction

In 1996, Congress created Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, and the college savings industry
was born. Named after the tax code section that authorized them, 529 plans have grown from a novel
idea to holding over $400 billion in assets. Every state now offers at least one plan, and the
competition for your college savings dollars has driven down fees and improved investment options
dramatically.

But 529s aren't the only municipal fund securities you'll encounter on the exam. ABLE accounts help
families save for disability-related expenses, while local government investment pools let
municipalities park their cash. What ties them together? They're all issued by state or local
governments, exempt from the Investment Company Act of 1940, and regulated by the MSRB instead of
the SEC.

A <span class="key-term">municipal fund security</span> is an investment product that is issued by a
state or municipality. Because a municipal fund security is issued by a state or local government,
it is exempt from the rules of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Instead, their sale is regulated
by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).

Income from municipal fund securities may be exempt from federal taxes and often state and local
taxes as well. The MSRB defines three kinds of municipal fund securities:

- Higher education savings plans, commonly referred to as <span class="key-term">529 plans</span>
- <span class="key-term">Local government investment pools (LGIPs)</span>
- <span class="key-term">ABLE accounts</span>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:

- Explain 529 college savings plan structure and tax benefits
- Distinguish between advisor-sold and direct-sold 529 plans
- Apply the superfunding rule for gift tax purposes
- Compare 529 savings plans with prepaid tuition plans
- Identify Coverdell ESA contribution limits and restrictions
- Understand LGIP structure and eligible participants
- Explain ABLE account eligibility and benefits

## 529 Plans and Other Education Savings Accounts

### 529 College Savings Plans

<span class="key-term">529 college savings plans</span> are designed to encourage saving for future
college costs. As with a 401(k), money can be deposited into separate accounts that invest in a
portfolio that is similar to a mutual fund. Investors cannot select individual stocks and bonds but
are limited to the portfolios offered by a state's 529 plan. Investment choices within the same plan
can be changed twice a year.

The earnings grow on a tax-deferred basis. If used for <span class="key-term">qualified educational
expenses</span>, withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes. In addition, some
states may offer tax deductions for contributions to these plans if the owner is a state resident.
The federal government does not offer any tax deductions for contributions to 529 accounts.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">QUALIFIED EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES</div>

- Tuition
- School fees
- Books
- School supplies and equipment, such as computers
- Reasonable room and board expenses (for students attending at least half-time)
- Expenses associated with special needs services
- Up to $10,000 in annual expenses for tuition at an elementary or secondary public, private, or
  religious school
- Up to $10,000 worth of student loan payments (in total, not per year) for the beneficiary or
  beneficiary's siblings
- Expenses associated with apprenticeship programs
</div>

### Characteristics of 529 Accounts

Any adult can establish a 529 account and name anyone (including themselves) as beneficiary. The
beneficiary can be any age, and the contributor and beneficiary do not need to be related. However,
529 accounts are typically set up by parents or grandparents with their children or grandchildren as
beneficiaries. Once a 529 account is established, anyone can contribute to it.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">529 ACCOUNT FEATURES</div>

- **No income limits** for making contributions
- **High contribution limits** that vary by state
- The individual who opens the account (not the beneficiary) **owns and controls** the account
- The owner can **change beneficiaries**
- Contributions are considered **gifts** under federal tax law
</div>

### Superfunding Rule

Contributions to a 529 plan are subject to federal gift tax limits. However, large gifts can be
spread over five years for tax purposes. Making five years' worth of contributions at once is called
<span class="key-term">superfunding</span> the 529 account.

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box__title">Example: Superfunding</div>
<p>Chris wants to contribute to a 529 account for their child. For the current year, the annual gift tax exclusion is $20,000. Chris uses the superfunding rule to make a $100,000 contribution ($20,000 × 5).</p>
<p>For tax purposes, Chris can treat this as a $20,000 gift this year, a $20,000 gift next year, etc. Each year's annual gift tax exclusion will be sufficient to cover the $20,000 for that year. Therefore, Chris will not owe any gift tax on the $100,000 contribution.</p>
</div>

### Nonqualified Withdrawals

If money is removed at any time for noneducational purposes:

- Any **earnings** will be taxed at the owner's ordinary income tax level
- Earnings will be subject to an additional **10% tax penalty**
- Withdrawals of **contributions** (principal) will not be taxed and are not subject to the 10%
  penalty
- All nonqualified withdrawals are assumed to be withdrawn on a proportional basis between earnings
  and principal

The penalty does not apply where a withdrawal is made because of the beneficiary's:

1. Death
2. Disability
3. Receipt of scholarship payment

### Plan-to-Plan Rollovers

Funds in a 529 account can be transferred from one state's 529 plan to another state's 529. This can
be done without tax consequences if the funds are deposited in the new account within 60 days of
withdrawal from the old plan. Plan-to-plan rollovers may be done only once in a 12-month period.

### Advisor-Sold vs. Direct-Sold Plans

Contributors may open a 529 college savings account in two different ways:

<div class="critical-concept">

</tbody>
</table>
</div>

### 529 Prepaid Tuition Plans

<span class="key-term">529 prepaid tuition plans</span> are a different kind of 529 plan. They are
**not considered municipal fund securities**, and therefore are **not subject to MSRB rules**.

Prepaid tuition plans generally allow participants to purchase units or credits at participating
colleges and universities to lock in current prices for future tuition and, in some cases, room and
board. Performance of these investments depends on tuition inflation. When tuition prices rise
quickly, prepaid tuition plans may be a good deal for participants because they have locked-in
prepaid tuition.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">PREPAID TUITION PLAN FEATURES</div>

- Most are sponsored by and sometimes guaranteed by **state governments**
- Have **residency requirements**
- Some are sponsored by colleges and universities
- Participants **do not choose investments**—the state or plan manager invests the money
- **Not considered securities** because owners are not provided with investment options
- Contributions are considered gifts; **superfunding rule applies**
</div>

### Coverdell Education Savings Accounts

<span class="key-term">Coverdell education savings accounts</span> (also called Coverdell ESAs or
CESAs) can be used to pay for qualified education expenses at elementary and secondary schools
(K-12), as well as any college or other post-secondary schools. These expenses include virtually any
type of educational cost, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment.

<div class="historical-note">
<div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
<p>Coverdell ESAs are not municipal fund securities, and therefore not subject to MSRB rules. However, they are an alternative to 529 college savings plans and may appear on the exam. Originally called "Education IRAs," they were renamed in 2001 after Senator Paul Coverdell, who championed their expansion to cover K-12 expenses.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">COVERDELL ESA RULES</div>

**Age Limits:**

- Beneficiary must be under age **18** when the CESA is created
- Additional contributions not permitted after beneficiary reaches age 18
- Funds must be used by age **30** (waived for special needs students)

**Contribution Limits:**

- Maximum annual contribution: **$2,000**
- If multiple accounts exist for the same beneficiary, total cannot exceed $2,000 annually

**Taxation:**

- Contributions are **not tax-deductible**
- Earnings grow **tax-deferred**
- Qualified withdrawals are **not taxed**
- Nonqualified withdrawals: earnings taxed at ordinary rates plus **10% penalty**
- Contributions count as **gifts** for gift tax purposes

**Income Limits:**

- **High earners cannot contribute**—phase-out rules similar to Roth IRAs apply

**Unused Funds:**

- May be rolled over to a CESA for a "family member" of the original beneficiary
</div>

## Local Government Investment Pools (LGIPs)

<span class="key-term">LGIPs</span> are trusts established by state and local governments that offer
municipal entities a place to invest their money. Government entities may use their surplus cash to
purchase interests in the LGIP, which invests the assets in a portfolio of securities according to
the trust's investment objectives and state laws.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">LGIP KEY FEATURES</div>

- Only **municipal governments and their agencies** may invest
- **Not open to the public**
- Benefits include:
  - Economies of scale
  - Diversification
  - Professional portfolio management
  - Liquidity
  </div>

<div class="info-box">
<div class="info-box__title">Example: LGIP</div>
<p>The state of Virginia offers public entities of Virginia the opportunity to participate in a professionally managed, AAA-rated LGIP. Under the Virginia statutes, the LGIP offers a competitive return with minimal risk of principal loss. The LGIP also offers liquidity and the benefits of large-scale institutional investment management.</p>
</div>

## ABLE Accounts

<span class="key-term">ABLE accounts</span> are designed to allow disabled people and their families
to save for the future on a tax-deferred basis. An ABLE account can hold up to $100,000 without
interfering with the disabled person's ability to qualify for federal Supplemental Security Income
(SSI) benefits.

<div class="critical-concept">
<div class="critical-concept__label">ABLE ACCOUNT RULES</div>

**Eligibility:**

- Disability must have begun **before age 46**
- A disabled person can only have **one ABLE account**
- Anyone may contribute to the account

**SSI Benefits:**

- ABLE account can hold up to **$100,000** without affecting SSI eligibility
- Only amounts **in excess of $100,000** count as an asset for SSI purposes

**Tax Treatment:**

- Contributions made with **after-tax dollars**
- Earnings and withdrawals **not taxed** if used for qualified disability expenses

**Qualified Disability Expenses:**

- Medical treatment
- Education
- Special needs transportation
- Other disability-related costs

**Ownership:**

- Unlike 529 accounts, the **beneficiary is also the owner** of the ABLE account
</div>

ABLE accounts work in a similar way to 529 accounts. States offer their own plans, and contribution
limits are the same as a state's 529 college savings plan. Many states allow nonresidents to open an
ABLE account in their state.
