## During the Exam

### Time Management

- **Total time**: 225 minutes (3 hours 45 minutes)
- **Questions**: 135 (125 scored + 10 pilot)
- **Target pace**: ~1.5-2 minutes per question
- **Check-in points**:
  - Question 45 = ~90 minutes in
  - Question 90 = ~180 minutes in
  - Save 30 minutes for review

### Strategy Tips

**For Calculation Questions:**

- Write out the formula first
- Show your work on scratch paper
- Double-check your math
- Make sure units match (×100 for options)

**For Conceptual Questions:**

- Read all four answers before choosing
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- Watch for absolutes ("always," "never")
- Trust your first instinct unless you find an error

**For "Except" Questions:**

- Underline "EXCEPT" or "NOT"
- Find the three TRUE statements
- The FALSE one is your answer

**For "Best" Questions:**

- Multiple answers may be partially correct
- Look for the MOST correct or complete answer
- Consider the specific situation given

### Break Strategy

- You can take an optional break
- Time continues during breaks
- Use it only if you really need to reset
- Stretch, use the bathroom, refocus

---

## If You Get Stuck

1. **Mark it and move on** - Don't spend 5 minutes on one question
2. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Even 50/50 is better than random
3. **Use common sense** - If an answer seems absurd, it probably is
4. **Remember key patterns**:
   - Buyers have rights, sellers have obligations
   - Reg T = 50%, maintenance = 25% long / 30% short
   - Premium bonds: yields decrease (N > C > YTM)

---

## After the Exam

## Mental Reminders

**Before the exam:**

> "I've prepared for this. I know this material. Trust the process."

**During tough questions:**

> "Mark it and move on. I can come back to it."

**If anxiety hits:**

> "Take a breath. This is just one question. Focus on what I know."

**Remember:**

- You don't need to get every question right
- 72% is passing—that's 90 out of 125
- You can miss 35 questions and still pass
- Focus on the questions you know, not the ones you don't

---

## Final Words

You've done the work. You've learned the material. The exam is just a demonstration of what you
already know.

Go get that Series 7.
