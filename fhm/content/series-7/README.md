## Study Tips

### For Calculation Topics
Options and margin require practice. Don't just read—work through calculations until they're automatic. The exam doesn't give you time to figure out formulas from scratch.

### For Rules and Regulations
Understand the "why." Every FINRA rule exists because something went wrong. When you know the story behind the rule, you remember it.

### For Product Knowledge
Focus on distinguishing features. What makes a revenue bond different from a GO bond? What separates Class A from Class C shares? Comparison is key.

### For Practice Exams
Take them under realistic conditions—timed, no breaks, no notes. Your first practice exam score doesn't matter; what matters is learning from what you missed.

## The Philosophy

This material is written the way a smart, experienced rep would explain it to you over coffee. We assume you're intelligent. We don't waste your time with padding. Every sentence is here because it helps you pass.

When something is complicated, we break it down. When there's history behind a rule, we tell you—because understanding why makes remembering what much easier.

And occasionally, we acknowledge the absurdity of some Wall Street conventions. One subtle observation per lesson. Because studying for this exam is hard enough without being boring.
