## What This Section Covers

This section tests whether you understand the rules and best practices for building a client base. It's about the front end of the business—before accounts are opened, before trades are placed.

Topics include:
- Prospecting methods (referrals, seminars, cold calling)
- Communications with the public
- Advertising and sales literature rules
- Do-Not-Call regulations
- Telemarketing requirements
- Networking and business development

### Why It Matters

While this is only 9% of the exam, it's foundational for your career. Violating prospecting rules can result in fines, suspension, or termination. Understanding these regulations keeps you compliant from day one.
