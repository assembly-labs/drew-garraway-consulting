# Types of Customers

## Introduction

In 1999, Merrill Lynch paid a $15 million settlement for treating retail customers like institutional investors—recommending complex structured products without the disclosures those customers deserved. The distinction between retail and institutional customers isn't just academic. It determines what you can recommend, what you must disclose, and how much hand-holding the regulations expect you to provide.

Understanding who you're talking to is the first step in building a compliant practice. Get the classification wrong, and you're exposed—even if your recommendations were sound.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Distinguish between retail and institutional customers
- Identify the criteria for institutional investor classification
- Explain how customer type affects suitability and disclosure requirements
- Recognize when an individual qualifies as an accredited investor

## Retail Customers

A <span class="key-term">retail customer</span> is essentially anyone who isn't an institution. This includes:

- Individual investors
- Small business owners investing personal funds
- Family trusts (in most cases)
- Most retirement accounts

### What Makes Retail Different

Retail customers receive the highest level of regulatory protection because they're presumed to have:
- Less investment sophistication
- Fewer resources for independent analysis
- Greater reliance on representative recommendations

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Practical Implication</div>
  <p>When communicating with retail customers, every piece of sales literature and advertising requires principal approval before first use. With institutional customers, the rules are more relaxed.</p>
</div>

### Retail Communication Requirements

Communications with retail customers (more than 25 retail investors in 30 days) require:
- Principal pre-approval before first use
- Fair and balanced presentation
- Clear disclosure of risks
- No predictions of future performance

---

## Institutional Customers

An <span class="key-term">institutional customer</span> is a sophisticated entity presumed to have the resources and expertise to evaluate investments independently.

### Who Qualifies as Institutional?

Under FINRA rules, institutional customers include:

| Entity Type | Minimum Threshold |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Banks, savings associations, insurance companies | Any size |
| Registered investment companies (mutual funds) | Any size |
| Registered investment advisers | Any size |
| Any other entity | $50 million+ in assets |
| Government entities | Any size |

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The $50 million threshold was established because regulators determined that entities of this size typically employ professional investment staff and can fend for themselves in negotiations with broker-dealers. Below this threshold, an entity might be sophisticated in its own business but lack investment expertise.</p>
</div>

### Institutional Communication Rules

Communications to institutional investors have relaxed requirements:
- No pre-approval required (but firm must have procedures)
- Can include more technical content
- Less prescriptive about risk disclosures
- Still must be fair and not misleading

## Accredited Investors

An <span class="key-term">accredited investor</span> is a retail investor who meets certain wealth or income thresholds, qualifying them for investments not available to the general public (like private placements).

### Individual Accredited Investor Criteria

An individual qualifies if they have:
- Net worth exceeding $1 million (excluding primary residence), OR
- Income exceeding $200,000 in each of the past two years (or $300,000 combined with spouse) with reasonable expectation of the same

### Why It Matters

Accredited investors can participate in:
- Private placements (Regulation D offerings)
- Hedge funds
- Venture capital investments
- Other securities exempt from full SEC registration

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Don't confuse "institutional" with "accredited." A wealthy individual investor is still a retail customer for FINRA communication purposes—even if they're accredited for securities law purposes.</p>
</div>

## Why Classification Matters

The customer classification affects everything downstream:

| Requirement | Retail Customer | Institutional Customer |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Communication pre-approval | Required | Not required |
| Suitability analysis | Full documentation | Can be modified if customer opts out |
| Disclosure requirements | Extensive | Reduced |
| Supervision level | Higher | Standard |

---

## Common Misconceptions

1. **Misconception**: High-net-worth individuals are institutional customers
   - **Reality**: Individuals are always retail, regardless of wealth. Classification is based on entity type, not wealth.

2. **Misconception**: Accredited investors don't need suitability analysis
   - **Reality**: Accredited status affects what can be offered, not whether suitability applies. Suitability always applies to recommendations.

## Test Preparation

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Remember the $50 million threshold for entities. Banks, insurance companies, and registered investment companies qualify automatically regardless of size.</p>
</div>

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Retail = individuals and small entities**: Higher protection, stricter communication rules
2. **Institutional = large entities or financial professionals**: Presumed sophisticated
3. **$50 million threshold**: For entities not automatically classified
4. **Accredited ≠ Institutional**: Accredited investors are still retail customers

### Exam Traps to Avoid

- Individual with $100 million? Still retail.
- Bank with $10 million in assets? Still institutional (banks qualify automatically).
- Trust with $50 million? Depends on who controls it—often treated as retail.

## Summary

Customer classification determines the level of regulatory protection applied to a relationship. Retail customers receive the most protection through stricter communication and disclosure requirements. Institutional customers—defined as financial entities or those with $50 million+ in assets—are presumed sophisticated enough to need less regulatory hand-holding. Accredited investors are a securities law concept that affects what investments can be offered, but doesn't change their retail classification for FINRA purposes.

Getting this right at the start prevents compliance headaches later. And as Merrill Lynch learned in 1999, treating customers as more sophisticated than they are can be an expensive mistake.

### Quick Reference

**Key Terms:**
- <span class="key-term">Retail Customer</span>: Individual investors and small entities; highest protection level
- <span class="key-term">Institutional Customer</span>: Banks, insurance companies, investment companies, or entities with $50M+ assets
- <span class="key-term">Accredited Investor</span>: Individual meeting income/net worth thresholds for private offerings

**Critical Numbers:**
- $50 million: Asset threshold for entity institutional classification
- $1 million: Net worth threshold for accredited investor (excluding residence)
- $200,000: Individual income threshold for accredited investor ($300,000 joint)
