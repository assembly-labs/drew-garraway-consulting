# Options

## This Is Your Biggest Challenge

In April 1973, the Chicago Board Options Exchange opened for business with just 16 call options on 16 different stocks. Trading volume that first day: 911 contracts. Today, the options market trades billions of contracts annually, and understanding options will account for roughly 25% of your Series 7 exam.

There's no way around it: if you can't calculate max gain, max loss, and breakeven for basic positions and spreads, you will not pass. But here's the good news—options follow logical patterns. Once you understand the underlying mechanics, the calculations become formulaic.

Let's build that understanding.

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 1: Options Fundamentals
Before you can strategize, you need vocabulary. What's a call? What's a put? Who has rights and who has obligations? This chapter builds the foundation.

### Chapter 2: Options Pricing
Why is one option worth more than another? Intrinsic value, time value, and the factors that move premiums. This is where pricing makes sense.

### Chapter 3: Basic Strategies
The four basic positions (long call, long put, short call, short put) plus the essential combinations: covered calls and protective puts. Each one has a purpose.

### Chapter 4: Spread Strategies
Bull spreads, bear spreads, debit spreads, credit spreads. How to limit risk while maintaining exposure to price movements.

### Chapter 5: Options Calculations
The math. Max gain, max loss, breakeven for every position and strategy. This is drill territory—practice until automatic.

## The Options Framework

Every options question comes down to understanding this framework:

| | Buyer (Long) | Seller (Short) |
|---|---|---|
| **Call** | Right to BUY at strike | Obligation to SELL at strike |
| **Put** | Right to SELL at strike | Obligation to BUY at strike |

**Buyers pay premium and have rights.**
**Sellers receive premium and have obligations.**

Everything else builds from here.

## Key Formulas You'll Master

### Long Call
- **Max Gain:** Unlimited
- **Max Loss:** Premium paid
- **Breakeven:** Strike + Premium

### Long Put
- **Max Gain:** Strike - Premium (×100)
- **Max Loss:** Premium paid
- **Breakeven:** Strike - Premium

### Short Call (Naked)
- **Max Gain:** Premium received
- **Max Loss:** Unlimited
- **Breakeven:** Strike + Premium

### Short Put
- **Max Gain:** Premium received
- **Max Loss:** Strike - Premium (×100)
- **Breakeven:** Strike - Premium

### Covered Call
- **Max Gain:** (Strike - Stock Cost) + Premium
- **Max Loss:** Stock Cost - Premium
- **Breakeven:** Stock Cost - Premium

## Study Approach

### Phase 1: Concepts (5-7 hours)
Master the vocabulary and basic mechanics. Don't move on until you can explain:
- Call vs. put
- Buyer vs. seller
- Rights vs. obligations
- Intrinsic vs. time value

### Phase 2: Basic Positions (8-10 hours)
Learn each of the four basic positions cold:
- When you'd use each
- Max gain, max loss, breakeven
- Bullish, bearish, or neutral

### Phase 3: Strategies (10-12 hours)
Covered calls, protective puts, then spreads. Each strategy exists because traders wanted to solve a specific problem.

### Phase 4: Drill (Ongoing)
Use the calculation worksheets. The formulas need to be automatic on exam day.

## Memory Aids

### Call Up, Put Down
- **Call** is in-the-money when market is **UP** (above strike)
- **Put** is in-the-money when market is **DOWN** (below strike)

### Buyers Pay, Sellers Receive
- If you're **long**, you **paid** (debit)
- If you're **short**, you **received** (credit)

### Premium Is Your Risk/Reward Anchor
- **Buyers** can only lose the premium they paid
- **Sellers** can only gain the premium they received
- (Unless they're naked, in which case sellers can lose a lot more)

## The Calculation Mindset

Here's what trips people up: they try to reason through each problem from scratch. Don't. Use formulas.

For any position, ask:
1. **What's the best case?** (Max gain)
2. **What's the worst case?** (Max loss)
3. **What's the magic number?** (Breakeven)

Then apply the formula. No philosophy, just math.
