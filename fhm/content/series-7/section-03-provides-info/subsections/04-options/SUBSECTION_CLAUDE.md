## Calculation Focus

### Every Options Lesson Needs:
1. Clear formula presentation
2. Step-by-step worked example
3. Multiple practice problems
4. Common mistake warnings

### Key Formulas

**Long Call:**
- Max Gain: Unlimited
- Max Loss: Premium paid
- Breakeven: Strike + Premium

**Long Put:**
- Max Gain: Strike - Premium (×100)
- Max Loss: Premium paid
- Breakeven: Strike - Premium

**Short Call (Naked):**
- Max Gain: Premium received
- Max Loss: Unlimited
- Breakeven: Strike + Premium

**Short Put:**
- Max Gain: Premium received
- Max Loss: Strike - Premium (×100)
- Breakeven: Strike - Premium

**Covered Call:**
- Max Gain: (Strike - Stock Cost) + Premium
- Max Loss: Stock Cost - Premium
- Breakeven: Stock Cost - Premium

**Spreads:**
- Max Gain/Loss = Difference in strikes - Net premium (or net premium for credit)
- Debit spread: Pay net premium, want maximum spread between values
- Credit spread: Receive net premium, want both to expire worthless

---

## Memory Aids to Include

### Call Up, Put Down
- Call is in-the-money when market is UP (above strike)
- Put is in-the-money when market is DOWN (below strike)

### Buyers Have Rights, Sellers Have Obligations
- Long = bought = has rights (can exercise)
- Short = sold = has obligations (must fulfill)

### Premium Flow
- Buyers PAY premium (debit)
- Sellers RECEIVE premium (credit)

### Spread Types
- Bull = want price to go UP
- Bear = want price to go DOWN
- Debit = you PAY (want wider spread)
- Credit = you RECEIVE (want narrower spread/expiration)

---

## Content Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
Options can be intimidating. Use FHM voice to:
- Break down complexity step by step
- Use concrete examples with specific prices
- Acknowledge that this is hard but learnable
- One humor moment per lesson (not forced)

### Example Quality
Every example should include:
- Specific stock symbol (even fictional like XYZ)
- Specific strike price ($50, not "strike price")
- Specific premium ($3, not "premium")
- Specific market price at expiration

**Good:** "An investor buys 1 XYZ Jan 50 call at $3. At expiration, XYZ is trading at $58."

**Bad:** "An investor buys a call option. At expiration, the stock is above the strike price."

### Tables for Strategies
Use comparison tables:

| Position | Direction | Max Gain | Max Loss | Breakeven |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Long Call | Bullish | Unlimited | Premium | Strike + Premium |
| Long Put | Bearish | Strike - Premium | Premium | Strike - Premium |

## Common Exam Traps

1. **Forgetting ×100**: Options represent 100 shares
2. **Buyer vs. Seller confusion**: Who has rights vs. obligations
3. **Debit vs. Credit**: Which way money flows
4. **Covered vs. Naked**: Risk profiles differ dramatically
5. **Bull spread types**: Bull CALL spread is debit; Bull PUT spread is credit
6. **Assignment**: Short options can be assigned
