## Content Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

FHM voice is especially important here because this content is dense:
- Break complex topics into digestible pieces
- Use concrete examples with specific numbers
- Explain the "why" behind regulations
- One humor moment per lesson (don't overdo it in technical content)

### Section-Specific Notes

- **Calculation lessons need step-by-step examples**
- **Strategy lessons need clear diagrams/tables**
- **Every product needs suitability discussion**
- **Cross-reference related topics** (options + margin, munis + taxes)

### Opening Hook Ideas

- The 1973 CBOE opening (options)
- Orange County bankruptcy (munis)
- 1929 margin speculation (Reg T)
- Michael Milken and junk bonds
- Flash crashes and circuit breakers
