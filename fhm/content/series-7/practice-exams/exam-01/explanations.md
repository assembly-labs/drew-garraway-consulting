## Section 3: Provides Information

### Question 7 - Answer: C ($54)

The stock must rise above $54 for the investor to profit after accounting for the premium paid.

---

### Question 8 - Answer: B ($500 loss)

**Short put calculation:**

- Premium received: $3 × 100 = $300
- Stock at expiration: $32 (below $40 strike)
- Put is exercised: Must buy at $40, stock worth $32
- Loss on stock: ($40 - $32) × 100 = $800
- Net result: $300 - $800 = **-$500 (loss)**

### Question 9 - Answer: B

**Limited gain potential, limited loss potential**

Covered call = own stock + write call:

### Question 10 - Answer: B

**Bull call spread with max gain of $700**

- Buy lower strike call ($60 at $5) = bullish
- Sell higher strike call ($70 at $2) = limit upside
- Net debit: $5 - $2 = $3 (max loss = $300)
- Max gain: ($70 - $60) - $3 = $7 × 100 = **$700**

---

### Question 11 - Answer: D

---

### Question 16 - Answer: C ($5,000)

**SMA = Equity - (Market Value × 50%)**

Equity: $60,000 - $25,000 = $35,000 Minimum required: $60,000 × 50% = $30,000 SMA: $35,000 - $30,000
= **$5,000**

---

### Question 17 - Answer: B ($40.00)

**Margin call trigger = Debit ÷ (1 - maintenance %)**
