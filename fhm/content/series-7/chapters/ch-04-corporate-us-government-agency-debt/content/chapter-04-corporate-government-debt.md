# Chapter 4: Corporate, U.S. Government, and Agency Debt

*Series 7 Exam Weight: ~12-15 Questions (10%)*

---

## Section 1: Corporate Debt

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in American history—$639 billion in assets, gone. Bondholders scrambled to understand their place in line. Secured creditors recovered most of their money. Unsecured bondholders? Not so much. The hierarchy of corporate debt isn't just academic theory—it determines who gets paid when companies fail.

### Why This Section Matters

When corporations need capital, they issue debt securities with different structures, security levels, and risk profiles. Understanding the differences between secured bonds, debentures, and subordinated debt—and who gets paid first in bankruptcy—is essential for the Series 7 exam.

---

### Topic 1: Characteristics of Corporate Debt

Corporations issue bonds to raise capital. In the past, there were two types: bearer bonds (with coupons attached) and fully registered bonds.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">From Paper to Electronic</div>
  <p>Bearer bonds were historically issued in physical form with coupons attached. No records were kept of the owner—whoever held the bond could collect interest. The attached coupons were clipped and sent to receive payment. Today, we continue to use the term "coupon" to refer to the stated interest rate (nominal yield) for debt instruments. Bearer bonds are no longer issued.</p>
</div>

Today, <span class="key-term">fully registered bonds</span> are registered as to principal and interest. The <span class="key-term">registrar</span> keeps track of owners of record. The <span class="key-term">paying agent</span> sends semiannual interest payments directly to the registered owner. At maturity, the paying agent sends the final $1,000 principal repayment.

Fully registered bonds are issued as <span class="key-term">book entries</span>—they have no physical certificates. Advanced name, address, and purchase amount are registered with the <span class="key-term">transfer agent</span>. All new issues of bonds in the United States are book entries.

#### The Indenture

Bonds are issued under a bond contract called an <span class="key-term">indenture</span>. The indenture defines the interest rate, maturity, collateral, and all other features of the bonds. The indenture may also require the corporation to maintain specific <span class="key-term">protective provisions</span> or <span class="key-term">covenants</span>. Protections can include:

- Insurance coverage
- Audit by an independent accountant
- Ratios of assets to liabilities

An independent <span class="key-term">trustee</span> is appointed to monitor compliance with the indenture provisions. The trustee ensures that the corporation adheres to the indenture.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> All corporate issues of $50,000,000 or more must have a trust indenture as specified by the <span class="key-term">Trust Indenture Act of 1939</span>. Municipal and government issues are exempt and therefore not subject to this requirement.</p>
</div>

#### Settlement and Trading

<span class="key-term">Regular way settlement</span> for corporate bond trades is 1 business day after the trade date (T+1). If the buyer and seller agree, other settlement arrangements can be made. Corporate bonds trade in increments of 1/8 of a point.

<span class="key-term">Cash settlements</span> occur the same day as the trade date if the trade is done before 2:30 p.m. ET.

---

### Topic 2: Secured Bonds

Corporate bonds can be <span class="key-term">secured</span> or <span class="key-term">unsecured</span>. Secured bonds have collateral (property or other valuable items) pledged to back the bond issue. The bondholders have claim to the collateral if the issuer defaults. This helps secured bondholders avoid losing their investment (capital risk). Unsecured bonds have no collateral backing.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Secured Bond Advantage</div>
  <p>All things being equal, secured bonds are sold at lower interest rates than unsecured bonds because of the extra protection provided by the collateral. Secured bonds are typically issued with long-term maturities.</p>
</div>

#### Mortgage Bonds

<span class="key-term">Mortgage bonds</span> are issued with real estate or real property (equipment) pledged as collateral. The bondholder has a <span class="key-term">lien</span> (legal claim) on the pledged real estate. This gives the bondholder the legal right to the proceeds of the sale if the bondholders' claims are not satisfied.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Open-End vs. Closed-End Mortgage Bonds</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open-end indenture:</strong> The issuer can sell additional bonds having equal claim on the same real estate. Typically includes an <span class="key-term">additional bonds test</span> that must be met before new bonds can be sold.</li>
    <li><strong>Closed-end indenture:</strong> New mortgage bonds can only be issued against the real estate if they are junior (lower status in liquidation) to existing bonds.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Equipment Trust Certificates

<span class="key-term">Equipment trust certificates</span> are backed by equipment owned by the issuing corporation that is pledged as collateral. This is the typical form of financing for common carriers such as airlines, trucking companies, and railroads. For example, if United Airlines wants to buy new planes, it will finance the purchase by issuing equipment trust certificates. The planes are collateral.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Equipment Trust Certificate Features</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Unlike most other corporate debt (which are term issues), equipment trust certificates are issued in <strong>serial</strong> form</li>
    <li>Serial bonds require the issuer to repay a portion of the principal each year until the bonds are retired</li>
    <li>The life of the issue coincides with, or is less than, the equipment's life</li>
    <li>Highly rated because if the issuer defaults, the equipment can easily be sold to repay bondholders</li>
    <li>Generally non-callable, allowing investors to avoid call risk</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Collateral Trust Certificates

<span class="key-term">Collateral trust certificates</span> are issued with a portfolio of marketable securities as collateral. Typically, a parent company uses the securities of a subsidiary as collateral.

---

### Topic 3: Unsecured Debt Instruments

Unsecured corporate debt is only backed by the issuer's promise to pay. There is no collateral backing the issue. Unsecured debt is issued in short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term maturities. These include commercial paper, debentures, and income bonds.

#### Commercial Paper

<span class="key-term">Commercial paper</span> is used for short-term corporate financing needs. Maturities typically range from 14 to 365 days, with 30 days being the most common. The maturity will rarely exceed 270 days because the issue would then have to be registered with the SEC.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Commercial Paper Characteristics</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Semiannual interest payments cannot be made because of short-term nature</li>
    <li>Sold at a discount and matures at face value (like a zero-coupon bond)</li>
    <li>The difference is the earned income, which is received at maturity</li>
    <li>Sold in large units with a $100,000 minimum denomination</li>
    <li>Purchasers are large institutions with excess cash to invest</li>
    <li>Very limited trading—most investors simply hold to maturity</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Debentures

<span class="key-term">Debentures</span> are intermediate and long-term unsecured corporate debt. Credit risk is higher for debentures than for secured bonds, as debentures are only backed by the issuer's promise to pay. Debentures are often issued by stronger companies with solid financials.

<span class="key-term">Subordinated debentures</span> have a junior (lower) status in corporate liquidations (bankruptcies). These issues rank lower than other, more senior debt such as secured debt or standard debentures. In a company liquidation, subordinated debentures are paid after all other creditors, but ahead of any equity holders. Subordinated debentures may include a conversion feature that allows the bondholder to convert the bond into a fixed number of common shares.

#### Guaranteed Bonds

<span class="key-term">Guaranteed bonds</span> are another form of debenture. These bonds are typically issued by a subsidiary company with a corporate parent guaranteeing payment of interest and principal as due. These bonds take on the credit rating of the guarantor.

#### Income Bonds

<span class="key-term">Income bonds</span> are issued as part of a corporate reorganization. An issuer will default on any outstanding debt when a corporation goes bankrupt. The company may then try to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy. Part of the reorganization is convincing the existing bondholders to surrender any claims under the old bonds and accept a new type of bond. This new bond is an income bond that only obligates the issuer to pay if it has sufficient earnings in the future. These are also referred to as <span class="key-term">adjustment bonds</span>.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Income bonds are not suitable for investors seeking income because payments are not guaranteed. In addition, if an income bond has missed a payment, it is not considered to be in default.</p>
</div>

#### Accrued Interest

Most bonds trade with <span class="key-term">accrued interest</span>, which means the price includes any interest that has accrued on the bond from the last interest payment date until the day before the settlement date. Accrued interest is paid by the buyer to the seller of a bond. The amount of accrued interest is included on both the buyer's and seller's trade confirmation.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Accrued Interest Conventions</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Bond Type</th>

      <td>T+1</td>
      <td>actual/actual</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Questions may simply ask for the accrued interest convention (30/360 vs. actual/actual), based on the type of bond. You may also get a question asking you to calculate the actual number of days.</p>
</div>

---

### Topic 4: Convertible Bonds

<span class="key-term">Convertible bonds</span> are corporate debentures that can be converted, at the option of the bondholder, into common stock of the issuer. A <span class="key-term">conversion price</span> is set per share at the time of issuance. The bond can then be converted into a fixed number of common shares based on its par value.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Convertible Bond Example</div>
  <table>
    <tr><td>Par value</td><td>$1,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Current bond price</td><td>$900</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Conversion price</td><td>$50 per share</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Shares upon conversion</td><td>20 ($1,000 par ÷ $50 conversion price)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Current stock price</td><td>$40</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Stockholder benefit break point</td><td>$50</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Conversion Ratio and Parity

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Conversion Ratio Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Conversion Ratio = Par Value of Bond ÷ Conversion Price</div>
  <p>Example: $1,000 ÷ $50 = 20:1</p>
</div>

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Parity Price of Bond</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Parity Price of Bond = Conversion Ratio × Stock's Market Price</div>
  <p>For the bond to be of equal value to the 20 shares of stock currently trading at $40 per share, the bond must trade for $800. Since the current market price is $900, the bond is trading above its parity price.</p>
</div>

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Parity Price of Stock</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Parity Price of Stock = Bond Market Value ÷ Conversion Ratio</div>
  <p>The market price of the stock must be $45 for the stock to be at parity ($900 ÷ 20 = $45). At $40, the stock is selling below its parity value.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Convertible Bond Behavior</div>
  <ul>
    <li>When the bond trades <strong>above parity</strong>, there is no reason to convert into stock—the stock received would be worth less than the bond's current market value</li>
    <li>When the bond trades <strong>below parity</strong>, it would be profitable to convert into stock</li>
    <li><strong>Arbitrage:</strong> Traders buy the lower-priced security and simultaneously sell the equivalent higher-priced security to lock in a profit</li>
    <li>Arbitrage only works when the bond trades below parity</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Benefits of Convertible Bonds

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>For the Issuer</th>
      <th>For the Investor</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can sell bonds with a lower coupon because of conversion feature</td>
      <td>Potential to convert to shares when common stock appreciates</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lower interest payments to make</td>
      <td>Any capital gains or losses will be bondholder's when converted</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Convertibles have one other complication: they are usually callable by the issuer. When a convertible bond is called, the bondholder can avoid redeeming the bond by converting it instead. If the shares are worth more than the par value plus call premium, most bondholders will convert. When bondholders choose to convert in response to a call, this is known as <span class="key-term">forced conversion</span>.</p>
</div>

### Topic 5: Priorities in Liquidation

When a corporation liquidates in bankruptcy, creditors are paid in a specific order:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Bankruptcy Payment Priority</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Priority</th>
      <th>Creditor Type</th>

    <tr>
      <td>1st</td>
      <td>Secured creditors (mortgage bondholders, equipment trust certificate holders)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2nd</td>
      <td>Unpaid administrative claims, unpaid wages, taxes, trade creditors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3rd</td>
      <td>Unsecured creditors (debenture bondholders)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

## Section 2: U.S. Government Debt and Agency Obligations

In 2011, Standard & Poor's downgraded U.S. government debt from AAA to AA+ for the first time in history. The market reaction? Investors bought more Treasuries, not fewer. When the world panics, it still runs to U.S. government debt—the ultimate safe haven. Understanding these securities and the agencies that support them is essential.

### Why This Section Matters

U.S. government securities form the backbone of the global fixed-income market. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds—plus the complex world of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies—appear frequently on the Series 7 exam.

---

### Topic 1: Characteristics of U.S. Government Debt

The U.S. government issues debt to finance the running of the government. The market for U.S. government debt is the largest and most active trading market in the world. Negotiable government debt issues take the form of long-term bonds, intermediate-term notes, and short-term bills known as Treasury bills.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Treasuries Are Special</div>
  <p>U.S. government bonds and the market participants are exempt from regulation under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does NOT oversee the issuance of U.S. government bonds or their trading. However, the Federal Reserve Board does have an oversight role in regulating banks.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Savings Bonds</div>
  <p><span class="key-term">Series EE bonds</span> are NOT part of this market—they are non-negotiable and cannot be traded. They are bought from the government and can only be redeemed with the government.</p>
</div>

#### Types of Treasury Securities

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Maturity</th>
      <th>Purchase Size</th>
      <th>Interest Paid</th>
      <th>Quotes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Treasury bills</strong></td>
      <td>One year or less</td>
      <td>$100 up to $5 million</td>
      <td>None; price at discount to par</td>
      <td>Yield</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Treasury notes</strong></td>
      <td>2 to 10 years</td>
      <td>$100 up to $5 million</td>
      <td>Semiannually</td>
      <td>Bond points in 32nds</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Treasury bonds</strong></td>
      <td>10 to 30 years</td>
      <td>$100 up to $5 million</td>
      <td>Semiannually</td>
      <td>Bond points in 32nds</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> For the exam, you can assume that all bond quotes will be in $1,000 minimums for corporate and municipal bonds. Treasury bonds are issued in minimum denominations of $100. Note that this differs from the $1,000 minimums for corporate and municipal bonds. Treasury bonds pay interest semiannually and are non-callable.</p>
</div>

#### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

<span class="key-term">Treasury bills</span> are short-term securities issued with 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month maturities on 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. T-bills are issued at a discount from par ($100 minimum) and mature at par. The discount earned is the interest income. They are quoted on a <span class="key-term">yield basis</span>.

Four week notes, bonds, and TIPS are sold by competitive bidding at a weekly auction conducted by the Federal Reserve.

#### STRIPS

<span class="key-term">STRIPS</span> were introduced for investors who wish to avoid reinvestment risk. STRIPS are Treasury bonds that have been stripped of their interest payments, making them zero-coupon Treasury obligations.

A STRIPS has two components: the semiannual interest payments represented by the coupons on the bond and the final principal repayment at maturity. A STRIPS bond strips off the coupons from the bond, leaving just the final principal repayment of $1,000. This creates a zero-coupon Treasury bond.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">STRIPS Example</div>
  <p>The bond is a 6%, 30-year STRIPS. It can be purchased right now for $175. Its principal value grows at a rate of 6% a year. At maturity, the bond will be redeemed at $1,000.</p>
  <p>STRIPS were designed for pension fund managers who want:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A safe, long-term investment</li>
    <li>No worry about reinvesting semiannual interest payments that could be subject to reinvestment risk if market interest rates fall</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)

<span class="key-term">TIPS</span> are designed for investors who want to avoid purchasing power risk. TIPS have a fixed interest rate over the life of the bond. The principal amount is adjusted every 6 months by an amount equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">TIPS Characteristics</div>
  <ul>
    <li>TIPS pay a fixed percentage of the adjusted principal value semiannually</li>
    <li>The interest payment will increase if the principal amount is adjusted upwards due to inflation</li>
    <li>Will decrease if the principal amount is decreased due to deflation</li>
    <li>TIPS have a <strong>lower interest rate</strong> than Treasury issues with a similar maturity due to the inflation protection feature</li>
    <li>TIPS are only available for long-term Treasury issues</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Topic 2: U.S. Government Agency and Sponsored Agency Obligations

There are many agencies and quasi-agencies of the U.S. government in addition to the U.S. Treasury. Securities issued by such agencies are considered low-risk, although <span class="key-term">government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)</span> such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not directly backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Agency Securities</div>
  <p>Agency securities offer somewhat higher yields than corresponding Treasury securities. Many agency securities are sold through a selling group of broker-dealers (called a syndicate) as opposed to the competitive auction process used by Treasuries. The dealers buy the bonds at a discount and resell them to the public at par. They are quoted in increments of 1/32 of a bond point.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs are still called "agency securities," even though a GSE is not actually a government agency but merely a corporation created by the federal government.</p>
</div>

#### Federal Farm Credit System

Farmers can secure low-rate financing through the <span class="key-term">Federal Farm Credit System</span>. The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation is a GSE that issues discount notes, intermediate-term bonds, and long-term bonds.

#### Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs)

<span class="key-term">Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs)</span> are issued by the following agencies:

- Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs)
- Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, Fannie Mae)
- Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC, Freddie Mac)

These agencies make a secondary market in home mortgages. They purchase the mortgages from the banks that originated the loans, enabling the banks to sell more mortgages.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">How MBSs Work</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>$25,000 minimum denominations:</strong> Once enough mortgages have been purchased, they are placed into a "pool"</li>
    <li>The agency then divides the pool into $25,000 mortgage-backed pass-through certificates and sells them to investors</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly payments:</strong> As mortgage payments are received from the pooled mortgages, the payments are funneled to the certificate holders (principal and interest)</li>
    <li>The certificates are self-liquidating as the mortgages are paid off</li>
    <li><strong>Prepayment risk:</strong> The length of the certificate depends on the underlying mortgages in the pool. Mortgage prepayments occur when homes are sold or mortgages are refinanced</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Prepayment risk increases when interest rates fall since homeowners are more likely to refinance in a low-interest-rate environment.</p>
</div>

#### Ginnie Mae (GNMA)

The <span class="key-term">Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, Ginnie Mae)</span> does not issue these securities, but does guarantee them on behalf of the federal government. Ginnie Mae is an actual government agency and not a GSE. For this reason, Ginnie Mae's agency securities have a higher credit rating and lower yield than those of other GSEs.

#### Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA, Sallie Mae)

The <span class="key-term">Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA, Sallie Mae)</span> purchases insured student loans from qualified lending institutions. Loans are purchased from colleges, universities, state agencies, and banks. Sallie Mae sells normal debentures paying interest semiannually, backed by these loans. The key point to remember here is that Sallie Mae does not deal in mortgage debt.

---

### Topic 3: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) and CDOs

<span class="key-term">Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)</span> are a type of structured product that invests in mortgage-backed securities. They are not exempt. Unlike MBSs which pass through mortgage payments equally to all investors, CMOs are structured in <span class="key-term">tranches</span> to divide risk among investors.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">CMO Tranches</div>
  <p>CMOs are structured in a variety of ways to divide the risk among the tranches to appeal to different types of investors. Shorter-term tranches generally offer lower yields. Tranches with the highest priority receive payments first.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sequential pay:</strong> The most basic CMO structure. Payments are applied to one tranche at a time.</li>
    <li><strong>Planned amortization class (PAC):</strong> PACs offer a high degree of cash flow stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Principal-only (PO):</strong> Investors in PO tranches receive only principal payments, no interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest-only (IO):</strong> Investors receive only interest payments, no principal.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">CMO Risks</div>
  <ul>
    <li>CMOs receive no principal or interest until the higher-priority tranches are completely paid off</li>
    <li>Z-tranches receive no principal or interest until the higher-priority tranches are completely paid off. For this reason, Z-tranches are typically traded at the highest yields.</li>
    <li>Unlike MBSs, CMOs are considered <strong>unsecured debt</strong>. They are securities that are issued by a private institution, not the government.</li>
    <li>The principal and interest on CMOs are NOT guaranteed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The other type of CMOs are principal-only (PO) and interest-only (IO). POs are issued at deep discount (below par) and interest-only (IO). POs are very sensitive to interest rate risk. If interest rates fall and prepayment speeds are faster than expected, the average life of the CMO will be shorter than the original estimate.</p>
</div>

#### Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)

A <span class="key-term">collateralized debt obligation (CDO)</span> is another type of structured product—similar to a CMO—but it may be backed by a pool of debt assets, including corporate bonds, bank loans, asset-backed securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Different investors may have different tolerances for risk. To satisfy the need of acquiring investors, it is called a <span class="key-term">collateralized bond obligation (CBO)</span>. These securities are issued overseas and are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but they are denominated in and pay interest in U.S. dollars.

---

### Topic 4: Trading and Tax Status

#### Customer Suitability and Public Communications

Broker-dealers must have a reasonable basis to believe that their recommendations to customers are suitable based on the customer's investment profile. The member must describe the CMO's characteristics and risks, how the CMO fits the customer's objectives, and the CMO's payment structure. The structure between a mortgage and Mortgage-backed securities is explained, auction schedule, and a glossary of terms. These suitability and customer communication requirements do not apply to institutional investors.
