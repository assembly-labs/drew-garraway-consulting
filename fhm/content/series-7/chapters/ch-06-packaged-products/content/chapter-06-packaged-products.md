## Section 1: Investment Company Basics

In 1924, Massachusetts Investors Trust became the first open-end mutual fund in America, allowing everyday investors to own a diversified portfolio of stocks. Before this innovation, diversification was a luxury only the wealthy could afford. Today, over $30 trillion sits in U.S. mutual funds alone—more than the GDP of most countries. Understanding how these investment vehicles work is essential for any securities professional.

### Why This Section Matters

Investment companies pool money from many investors to create diversified portfolios. The Series 7 exam heavily tests the differences between open-end and closed-end funds, how shares are priced, and the various fee structures. This chapter covers mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and other packaged products.

### Topic 1: Types of Investment Companies

An <span class="key-term">investment company</span> issues securities (such as common stock) and uses the proceeds to purchase other securities that are consistent with the company's investment goals (objectives). Individual investors buy shares of an investment company that best matches their own investment goals. The most common type of investment company is a <span class="key-term">mutual fund</span>.

Investment companies are required to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the <span class="key-term">Investment Company Act of 1940</span>. The act defines 3 types of investment companies:

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Face-amount certificate companies</strong></td>
      <td>An obsolete product; you need to know only that they are a type of investment company</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Unit investment trusts (UITs)</strong></td>
      <td>Fixed portfolio; shares redeemable to issuer</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Management Companies

A management company pools money from investors to create a <span class="key-term">portfolio</span> of securities (a fund). The fund hires an <span class="key-term">investment adviser</span> (fund manager) to make investment decisions based on the fund's investment objective. There are two types of management companies: open-end and closed-end.

      <th>Open-End (Mutual Funds)</th>
      <th>Closed-End Funds</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Trading at discount/premium</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)

A <span class="key-term">unit investment trust (UIT)</span> can be thought of as a container that holds a portfolio of securities. UITs are investment companies that operate as "pooled investments," similar to management companies. However, unlike management companies, UITs are typically unmanaged. A UIT typically does not have a management fee.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">UIT Characteristics</div>
  <ul>
    <li>UITs issue <span class="key-term">shares of beneficial interest</span> representing an undivided interest in a unit of the trust's portfolio</li>
    <li>Like mutual funds, a prospectus must be provided at or prior to an offer or sale</li>
    <li>UITs have a stated termination date that varies according to the type of investments in the portfolio</li>
    <li>Fixed UITs: Equity UITs typically mature in 15 months. Bond UITs are longer, terminating in 20 or 25 years.</li>
    <li>Units are typically redeemable, similar to a mutual fund</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Variable Annuity

<span class="key-term">Variable annuities</span> are not considered investment companies, but they do utilize investment companies to offer investment options to their customers. Annuities are generally used as retirement planning products. Individuals purchase units in a <span class="key-term">separate account</span> offered by a life insurance company to fund their future retirement income.

## Section 2: Management Company Basics (Mutual Funds)

### Topic 1: Fund Structure

Mutual funds are managed by an investment adviser who makes decisions about what securities to buy or sell. The fund charges fees for this service.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Key Fund Roles</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Investment adviser:</strong> Makes buy/sell decisions; largest expense</li>
    <li><strong>Board of directors:</strong> Oversees the fund; represents shareholders</li>
    <li><strong>Custodian:</strong> Holds the fund's securities and cash</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer agent:</strong> Processes purchases, redemptions, and recordkeeping</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Topic 2: Benefits of Mutual Funds

- **Diversification:** Reduces unsystematic risk
- **Professional management:** Expert investment decisions
- **Liquidity:** Shares redeemable at NAV
- **Convenience:** Easy to buy and sell
- **Affordability:** Low minimum investments

## Section 3: Buying and Selling Fund Shares

### Topic 1: Fund Pricing

<span class="key-term">Net Asset Value (NAV)</span> is computed daily. Every day, a mutual fund computes its net asset value (NAV) per common share. To do this, all securities held by the fund are <span class="key-term">marked to market</span> to find the total market value of all the fund's assets.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">NAV Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">NAV = (Total Assets - Liabilities) ÷ Shares Outstanding</div>
</div>

#### Forward Pricing

When a customer places an order to buy a mutual fund, they do not know the exact price they will pay because the purchase price is based on that day's closing NAV. Similarly, if a customer wishes to redeem a mutual fund, they receive that day's closing NAV.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Public Offering Price (POP)</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">NAV + Sales Charge = POP</div>
  <p>If the NAV is $9.50 and the sales charge is 5%, then:</p>
  <p>POP = NAV ÷ (100% - Sales Charge%) = $9.50 ÷ .95 = <strong>$10.00</strong></p>
</div>

The public offering price (POP) is the price an investor pays when buying mutual fund shares. When shares are redeemed, the seller receives the NAV (less any redemption fees). In other words, for mutual funds, the NAV is the bid price, and the POP is the ask price.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> NAV does not determine the price for a closed-end fund. Closed-end fund prices are based on supply and demand, just like any other traded security. A closed-end fund may trade at a discount to NAV or even at a premium.</p>
</div>

#### Maximum Sales Charge

Under <span class="key-term">FINRA</span> rules, the maximum sales charge for a mutual fund purchase is <strong>8.5% of POP</strong>.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Sales Charge Calculation</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>XYZ Mutual Funds</th>
      <th>NAV</th>
      <th>POP</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bond</td>
      <td>14.75</td>
      <td>16.12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Global</td>
      <td>14.70</td>
      <td>16.07</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Growth</td>
      <td>13.74</td>
      <td>15.02</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>High Income</td>
      <td>9.25</td>
      <td>9.71</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Sales Charge Percentage = (POP - NAV) ÷ POP</p>
</div>

### Topic 2: Breakpoints and Sales Discounts

<span class="key-term">Breakpoints</span> are quantity discounts offered to investors who purchase larger amounts. The more you invest, the lower your sales charge percentage.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Breakpoint Example</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Investment Amount</th>
      <th>Sales Charge</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Under $10,000</td>
      <td>5.50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$10,000 - $24,999</td>
      <td>5.00%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$25,000 - $49,999</td>
      <td>4.50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$50,000 - $99,999</td>
      <td>4.00%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$100,000+</td>
      <td>3.50%</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Ways to Reach Breakpoints</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Combination privilege:</strong> Combine purchases of different funds within the same fund family</li>
    <li><strong>Rights of accumulation:</strong> Current holdings plus new purchases count toward breakpoint</li>
    <li><strong>Letter of intent (LOI):</strong> Commit to investing a certain amount over 13 months to receive breakpoint discount now</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Section 4: Mutual Fund Expenses and Share Classes

### Topic 1: 12b-1 Fees

<span class="key-term">12b-1 fees</span> are annual fees deducted from fund assets to pay for marketing and distribution costs. Maximum 12b-1 fee is 0.75% annually (plus 0.25% service fee = 1.00% total).

### Topic 2: Share Classes

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Share Class</th>
      <th>Sales Charge</th>
      <th>12b-1 Fees</th>
      <th>Best For</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Class A</strong></td>
      <td>Front-end load (upfront)</td>
      <td>Lower (or none)</td>
      <td>Large investments; long-term investors; accounts benefiting from breakpoints</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Class B</strong></td>
      <td>Back-end load (CDSC)</td>
      <td>Higher</td>
      <td>Intermediate-term investments; smaller amounts (although B shares may convert to A shares if held long enough)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Class C</strong></td>
      <td>No front or back-end</td>
      <td>Higher</td>
      <td>Short-term investors (less than one year); smaller investors who don't plan to hold for a long time</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<span class="key-term">Contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)</span> is assessed when shares are sold. The charge declines the longer the investor stays in the fund:
- 5% if redeemed within 2 years
- 4% if redeemed after 2 years
- 3% if redeemed after 3 years
- 2% if redeemed after 4 years
- 1% if redeemed after 5 years
- 0% if redeemed after 6 years

### No-Load Funds

<span class="key-term">No-load funds</span> are sold directly by a mutual fund sponsor and have no sales charges. Customers buy and redeem no-load funds at net asset value. The maximum 12b-1 fee for a no-load fund is .25% (25 basis points).

---

## Section 5: Fund Distributions and Prohibited Practices

### Subchapter M

Mutual funds that qualify under <span class="key-term">Subchapter M</span> of the IRS code can avoid double taxation. The fund must distribute at least 90% of its net investment income to shareholders. When it does, the fund itself is not taxed on that distributed income.

### Prohibited Sales Practices

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Prohibited Practices</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Breakpoint selling:</strong> Selling just below a breakpoint to deny the investor a discount</li>
    <li><strong>Switching:</strong> Moving client from one fund family to another without justification (generates new commissions)</li>
    <li><strong>Selling dividends:</strong> Encouraging purchase just before a distribution (investor pays taxes on the distribution)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Section 6: Other Packaged Products

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

<span class="key-term">ETFs</span> represent shares of ownership in a portfolio of common stock that typically tracks the performance of a specific index.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>ETFs</th>
      <th>Mutual Funds</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trading</td>
      <td>Throughout the day on exchange</td>
      <td>Once daily at closing NAV</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pricing</td>
      <td>Market price (supply/demand)</td>
      <td>NAV</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Management</td>
      <td>Usually passive (index tracking)</td>
      <td>Active or passive</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can be bought on margin</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Can be sold short</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sales charges</td>
      <td>No (but brokerage commission)</td>
      <td>May have sales charges</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Tax efficiency</td>
      <td>More tax efficient</td>
      <td>Less tax efficient</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Leveraged and Inverse ETFs

<span class="key-term">Leveraged ETFs</span> use derivative products to generate daily returns two to three times above the returns of the index they are tracking. For example, a triple-leveraged ETF (3× ETF) projects returns three times the returns of the tracked index.

<span class="key-term">Inverse ETFs</span> are designed to move in the opposite direction from the underlying index. For example, an S&P 500 inverse ETF is designed to move down 5% when the S&P 500 index moves up 5%.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Leveraged and inverse ETFs are suitable for sophisticated short-term speculators. FINRA has advised that these are not generally suitable for non-institutional investors who plan to hold for more than one trading session.</p>
</div>

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

A <span class="key-term">real estate investment trust (REIT)</span> is modeled after a mutual fund but focuses on real estate investments. A REIT either invests directly in real estate (an equity REIT), or in mortgages (a mortgage REIT). Unlike investors in a corporation, shareholders are given shares of beneficial interest in the trust.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">REIT Requirements</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Must distribute at least 90% of its income to shareholders</li>
    <li>At least 75% of the REIT's annual gross income must be real estate-related income (e.g., rents)</li>
    <li>At least 95% of the REIT's annual gross income must come from real estate-related income or dividends and income from other sources (e.g., stock market investments)</li>
    <li>At least 75% of total assets must be invested in real estate</li>
    <li>Must be managed by a board of directors or trustees</li>
    <li>Must have a minimum of 100 shareholders</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>REIT Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Private REITs</strong></td>
      <td>Exempt from SEC registration; typically offered only to institutional investors; limited or no liquidity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Registered non-listed REITs</strong></td>
      <td>Registered with SEC but do not trade on an exchange; lack liquidity because they cannot be traded</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Listed REITs</strong></td>
      <td>Most familiar type; registered with SEC and trade on an exchange or over-the-counter; highly liquid</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Hedge Funds

<span class="key-term">Hedge funds</span> are private investment partnerships that use aggressive strategies (short selling, leverage, derivatives) to seek high returns. They are not registered with the SEC and are available only to accredited investors.

### Direct Participation Programs (DPPs)

<span class="key-term">Direct participation programs (DPPs)</span> are limited partnerships that pass through income, gains, losses, and tax benefits directly to investors. Common types include oil and gas programs, real estate programs, and equipment leasing.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> DPPs are illiquid investments with no secondary market. They are suitable only for investors who can afford to have their money tied up for extended periods.</p>
