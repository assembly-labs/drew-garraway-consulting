## Folder Structure

Each chapter folder contains:

2. Screenshots stored locally in `ch-XX-*/screenshots/` (never committed)
3. Claude reads images and creates original FHM-voice content
4. Original content saved to `ch-XX-*/content/` (committed to git)
5. Only original content is deployed - never source screenshots
