## Section 1: Margin Accounts

### Introduction

- Customers can open different types of accounts at a broker-dealer
- In a cash account, a customer must deposit 100% of the purchase price of a security
- A margin account allows a customer to borrow either money or securities (in the case of a short
  sale) from a broker-dealer
- The rules for both cash and margin accounts are governed by the Federal Reserve under **Regulation
  T (Reg T)**
- FINRA also has additional requirements for opening and maintaining margin accounts
- A customer opens a margin account to borrow cash or securities from a broker-dealer. By borrowing,
  the investor is using leverage. Leverage can provide greater returns, but it can also result in
  greater losses
- Risks and returns are lower in a cash account, where the customer does not borrow money
- Due to the risky nature of margin, not all account types are permitted to use leverage. Custodial,
  fiduciary, and retirement accounts are generally ineligible for margin

### Topic 1: Regulation T: Buying on Margin

#### Initial Margin Requirements

- Regulation T (Reg T) is a Federal Reserve Board regulation that covers lending from broker-dealers
  to customers
- It sets **initial margin requirements** for marginable securities
- In a cash account, the initial margin requirement is 100%
- Under Reg T, a broker-dealer may lend a customer up to 50% of the purchase price of a **marginable
  security**

#### Initial Margins Set by Regulation T

|                         | Long Position | Short Position |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Stocks and convertibles | 50%           | 50%            |

#### Example

- A customer buys 200 shares of ABC (NYSE-listed) at $50 per share
- Under Reg T, the initial margin requirement is 50% of $10,000 = $5,000
- To purchase the stock in a margin account, the customer would be required to provide $5,000, and
  the broker-dealer would lend the customer the additional $5,000

#### Exempt Securities

- **Exempt securities** are not covered under Reg T. The major exempt securities are:
  - U.S. government securities
  - Agency issues
  - Municipal issues
  - Commercial paper
- The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has no power to set initial margins for these securities
- However, these securities are marginable, subject to **minimum maintenance requirements** set by
  FINRA
- While corporate bonds are nonexempt, the Fed does not set margins for these securities because
  their prices tend to be fairly stable. Again, only FINRA minimum maintenance margins apply

#### Deposit Requirements

- Reg T deposits must be made within 2 days of settlement
- A corporate security settles in 1 business day (T+1), so the Reg T deposit must be made by T+3
- The deposit of securities can be made instead of cash
- The customer may deposit fully paid marginable securities worth twice the amount of the call

#### Non-Marginable Securities

- Not all securities can be purchased on margin
- Nasdaq and all exchange-listed securities are marginable, as are U.S. government and municipal
  bonds
- Over-the-counter (OTC) securities are allowed only if they are listed on the Federal Reserve
  **marginable securities list**
- Newly issued securities cannot be purchased on margin until they have been publicly traded at
  least 30 days
- Because mutual fund shares are always considered new shares, they cannot be purchased on margin.
  But once mutual fund shares have been held for 30 days, they can be used as collateral for a
  margin loan

#### Marginable and Non-Marginable Securities Table

| Category                                                                      | Securities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Marginable securities** — securities that can be purchased on margin        | Exchange-listed securities (including Nasdaq and NYSE); U.S. government and agency securities; Investment-grade bonds and debentures; OTC securities listed on the Federal Reserve marginable securities list; Investment-grade money market instruments |
| **Non-marginable securities** — securities that cannot be purchased on margin | New issues that have been publicly traded for fewer than 30 days; Mutual fund shares and investment contracts such as variable annuities; Securities that sell for less than $5 per share                                                                |
| **Margin securities** — securities that can be used as collateral on loans    | Marginable securities; Mutual fund and unit investment trust (UIT) shares and investment contracts that have been owned for at least 30 days; Any convertible debt security that can be converted into a margin security                                 |

### Topic 2: Regulation T: Selling Short on Margin

#### Short Selling Basics

- **Short selling** is when an investor borrows securities from a broker-dealer and then sells them.
  This can only be done in a margin account
- **Note**: Fiduciary and retirement accounts are typically not permitted to sell short due to the
  strategy's unlimited loss potential
- A customer will use a short-selling strategy when they are bearish and believe that the price of
  the borrowed securities will fall
- Their strategy is to sell the securities at the current high price and then repurchase the
  securities at a cheaper price in the future
- After the investor buys the shares at a hopefully lower price, they return them to the
  broker-dealer (**covering** their short position)
- The difference between what they initially sold the shares for and what they purchased them for
  will be the customer's profit or loss

#### Summary

- Bullish investors hope to buy low and sell high
- Bearish investors hope to sell high and buy low

#### Initial Margin for Short Sales

- The Reg T initial margin requirement is the same for buyers and short-sellers — **50%**
- Example: A customer shorts 1,000 shares of XYZ stock at $10 per share. Reg T requires that the
  customer deposit 50% of the trade value, or $5,000

#### Minimum Deposit Requirement

- Margin accounts have a minimum equity requirement of **$2,000**
- For a long position, an initial purchase of less than $2,000 would require a 100% deposit of the
  purchase value
- For initial purchases between $2,000 and $4,000, the customer must deposit $2,000
- For purchases over $4,000, the customer must deposit at least 50%
- **Note**: For short accounts, the $2,000 minimum equity is an absolute requirement since the
  strategy has an unlimited loss potential

#### Minimum Margin Deposit Requirement Summary

| Under $2,000 (Long)   | Between $2k-$4k (Long)  | Over $4,000 (Long)   | Any Amount (Short) |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 100% Deposit Required | $2,000 Deposit Required | 50% Deposit Required | $2,000 Minimum     |

---

### Topic 3: Regulation T for Cash Accounts

#### Payment Requirements

- In a cash account, Reg T requires the broker-dealer to collect payment from the customer
  **promptly**, which means no later than 2 business days after the settlement date
- In a stock trade, regular way settlement is 1 business day after the trade (T+1)
- So, Reg T requires payment by the customer within 3 business days (S+2 = Settlement + 2 business
  days)

#### Reg T Extension

- If payment is not collected by S+2, under exceptional circumstances, the firm may request a Reg T
  extension from FINRA
- If granted, this gives the customer another 2 business days (or longer if a special request is
  made) to pay
- If the customer does not pay on either S+2 or the extension date (if one is granted), the firm is
  obligated to sell out that position and freeze the account for **90 days**

#### Frozen Accounts

- When an account is **frozen**, the customer can still trade in the account
- However, they can no longer borrow and must have 100% of the required cash to pay for the
  transaction
- After 90 days, given that the customer complies, the freeze is removed

#### Free-Riding

- **Free-riding** is the prohibited practice of buying securities without intending to pay for them,
  and then selling them on or before the settlement date to generate the cash needed to pay for the
  original purchase
- Example: XYZ will announce quarterly earnings in two days. A customer believes the news will be
  positive and decides to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at $50 per share. The customer does not have
  $50,000 to pay for the stock but plans to sell it when the price rises
- The customer is trying to take a "free ride" by using the broker-dealer to buy the stock. Relying
  on money from the sale of stock to pay for the purchase of the same stock is a violation
- The customer will not be allowed to keep the profits from such a trade, and their account will be
  frozen for 90 days
- During this time, customers cannot buy securities unless they already have the necessary cash in
  their account to cover the transaction

---

### Topic 4: Restricted Margin Accounts and Minimum Maintenance Requirements

#### Restricted Margin Accounts

- One first aspect of Reg T relates to what is known as a restricted margin account
- This is where the equity in the customer's account has fallen below 50%
- The formula for determining equity (ownership value) in a long margin account is:
  - **Equity Value = Long Market Value (LMV) of Security − Amount Owed Broker (Debit)**
  - **Equity Percentage = Equity Value ÷ Long Market Value (LMV) of the Security**

#### Example

- A customer buys $80,000 worth of stock in a margin account and deposits the required $40,000
  initial margin requirement and borrows $40,000 from the broker-dealer
- The next day, the stock's value declines to $60,000
- The long market value (LMV) is $60,000
- The customer owes the broker-dealer $40,000 (Debit)
- $60,000 − $40,000 = $20,000 of equity
- Equity of $20,000 ÷ long market value (LMV) of $60,000 = an equity percentage of 33.33%

- Since the equity percentage has fallen below 50%, the account is now **restricted**
- But this restriction has little impact on the customer
- They are not required to deposit any more money, the account is not frozen, and they can still buy
  more stock by depositing only 50% of the purchase price
- However, there are limits to how far the equity percentage in an account can fall. These limits
  are the **minimum maintenance requirements** established by FINRA

#### Short Account Equity

- **Note**: In a short margin account, equity is calculated using the formula:
  - Credit balance = Short Market Value (SMV) + Equity
  - The credit balance is the total value of the short sale, plus the 50% deposited by the customer.
    The SMV is the current market value of the shorted securities

#### Minimum Maintenance Requirements

- Under FINRA's minimum maintenance requirements, customers must keep a certain percentage of equity
  in the account at all times

#### FINRA Minimum Maintenance Margin

|                         | Long Position | Short Position |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Stocks and convertibles | 25%           | 30%            |

#### Margin Maintenance Call — Long Stock Example

- A customer buys $80,000 worth of stock in a margin account and deposits the required $40,000
  initial margin requirement and borrows $40,000 from the broker-dealer
- The minimum maintenance requirement for a long position is 25% of the market value, or $20,000
- A month later, the market value falls to $50,000. We can calculate the equity in the account as
  follows:
  - Market value of $50,000 − the $40,000 debt owed to the broker = $10,000 of customer equity
  - The equity percentage is now $10,000 of equity ÷ the $50,000 market value = 20%
- This is below the 25% minimum equity requirement. As a result, the customer will receive a
  **margin call**
- The margin call will be for an amount that will bring the account's equity back up to the minimum
  25% requirement
- The requirement is 25% of $50,000, or $12,500. In this case, the maintenance call may be met with
  $2,500 in cash or twice the amount in marginable securities

#### Short Account Margin Call

- In a short margin account, a margin call will be issued when equity drops below 30%
- To determine the point at which the margin call will occur, a helpful convention is to divide the
  credit balance by 1.3
- For example, a customer with a short margin account that has a credit balance of $130,000 will
  receive a margin call if the SMV in the account drops below $130,000 ÷ 1.3 = $100,000

#### Long Account Margin Call Trigger

- By the same convention, the point at which a long margin account will receive a maintenance call
  can be determined by dividing the debit balance by 0.75
- So, an account with a $50,000 debit balance will receive a margin call if its LMV falls below
  $66,666.67 ($50,000/0.75 = $66,666.67)

#### Meeting a Margin Call

- When a margin call occurs, it must be met promptly
- This often means within 3 business days, but depending on circumstances, it could be anywhere from
  the same day to 5 business days
- If the customer has not provided the required equity, the broker-dealer will sell the customer out
- This means the broker-dealer will sell enough stock to bring the account back to the required 25%
  minimum
- The customer has no control over which of the account's securities are sold

#### Broker-Dealer Maintenance Requirements

- Broker-dealers can, and usually do, establish more stringent (meaning higher) maintenance margin
  requirements than the 25% set by FINRA

#### Test-Taking Tip

- For the purpose of the test, you will not be required to complete many elaborate margin
  calculations. At a minimum, you will need to understand the basic requirements, including the
  following:

|                                              | Long Stock | Short Stock |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Regulation T initial margin requirement      | 50%        | 50%         |
| FINRA minimum maintenance margin requirement | 25%        | 30%         |

#### Special Memorandum Account (SMA)

- When a security purchased on margin increases in value, the equity in the account also increases
- Equity above 50% of the market value of the security is considered **excess equity**

#### Example

- A customer purchases 1,000 shares of XYZ at $50 per share, and the customer deposits the initial
  margin requirement of $25,000 (50%)
- The account then looks like this: $50,000 = loan amount of $25,000 + equity of $25,000
- Now assume the market value of the stock increases to $60 per share
- The account would now look like this: $60,000 = loan amount of $25,000 + equity of $35,000
- The Reg T amount for a long market value (LMV) of $60,000 is $30,000. So, the account would have
  $5,000 of excess equity ($35,000 equity − $30,000 Reg T requirement = $5,000 of excess equity)

#### SMA and Buying Power

- Excess equity creates buying power of 2 × SMA (since the initial margin requirement is 50%)
- This means the customer could use their $5,000 of excess equity to buy $10,000 of stock (meeting
  the 50% margin requirement)
- In addition, the special memorandum account (SMA) amount could be withdrawn from the account in
  cash
- But note that this withdrawal would be considered a loan and added to the amount that the customer
  owes the broker-dealer

---

### Topic 5: Other Types of Margin Accounts

#### Pattern Day Traders

- Customers who engage in day-trading strategies take on a higher level of risk
- Because day traders engage in rapid "in and out" transactions on the same day, at the end of the
  day, they have no position, and therefore, they would have no margin requirement under Reg T rules
- Due to the high level of risk, these accounts require special client disclosures

#### Pattern Day Trader Definition

- FINRA has its own margin rules for accounts that engage in "pattern day trading"
- The definition of a pattern day trader (PDT) subject to these rules is anyone who executes four or
  more day trades within five business days
- A day trade is a purchase and a sale of the same security (or vice versa) on the same day
- Note that a purchase on one day, followed by a sale the next day (or vice versa), is not defined
  as a day trade

#### $25,000 Minimum Equity to Open Account

- Instead of a $2,000 minimum equity to open and maintain an account, the minimum equity for a
  day-trading account is **$25,000** (a 12.5× premium)

#### Minimum Margin Is 25% of Highest Intraday Market Value

- Day traders must maintain a minimum margin percentage of 25%, which is the same as for regular
  accounts
- However, there is a big difference in the way it is computed
- Because a regular margin account has a market value balance at the end of each day, the minimum
  margin requirement for long positions is set at 25% of the end-of-day market value
- In contrast, a day-trading account would have no end-of-day market value. Instead, the 25% minimum
  is applied to the account's **highest intraday market value**, but in no case is it less than
  $25,000

#### Buying Power in Day-Trading Account = 4 Times Maintenance Excess

- Buying power in a pattern day-trading account is calculated completely differently than margin
  account buying power
- Pattern day-trading accounts are subject to FINRA's minimum margin rules, which require $25,000 in
  equity or 25% of the market value, whichever is greater
- There is no Reg T margin for these accounts as they typically do not carry securities positions
  into the next day
- If the account is "flat" (no balance at the end of the day), buying power is simply four times the
  cash balance at the end of the day. This is based on the 25% minimum maintenance requirement (1 ÷
  25 = 4)

#### Buying Power in Day-Trading Account with Outstanding Margin Call = 2 Times Maintenance Excess

- Normally, buying power in a pattern day-trading account is based on the fact that the account is
  only subject to the FINRA minimum maintenance margin of 25%, so the buying power is 1 ÷ .25 = 4
  times the maintenance margin excess
- However, if the account has an unsatisfied margin call outstanding, then the buying power is
  reduced to twice the maintenance margin excess

#### Portfolio Margin

- Until now, we've been discussing the standard method of computing margin requirements, which is
  strategy-based
- This means that a prescribed percentage margin is applied, as set by Reg T for initial margins and
  FINRA for minimum maintenance margins
- These margin requirements do not consider the actual risk of loss involved in each security
  position taken and are very conservative, resulting in higher margin requirements
- A different type of margin account assesses the risk of the entire account and considers variables
  such as hedging strategies and protective options, or offsetting long and short positions

#### Risk-Based Margin

- Portfolio margins assess the risk involved with a securities position to establish the margin
  requirement

#### Example

- Imagine a customer buys 100 shares of ABC stock in a margin account at $50 per share and buys a
  protective ABC 50 Put @ $5. This customer would be required to deposit 50% of the stock position
  and 100% of the put option premium under Reg T for a total of $2,500 + $500 = $3,000
- However, this customer cannot have a loss greater than $500 on this position. (The stock that was
  purchased at $50 can be sold via the put at $50, so the only loss is the $500 premium paid.) This
  would be the margin requirement under portfolio margin

#### Reduced Margin for Hedged Stock Positions

- The most dramatic effect of portfolio margin is to reduce the margin requirement for stock
  positions that are hedged by options positions, since the margin becomes the maximum potential
  loss, as in the example above
- In contrast, portfolio margins have no benefit for long options positions or spread positions,
  where the margin requirement already is the maximum potential loss

#### Portfolio Margin Not Permitted for Bond Positions

- Initially, portfolio margins were only used for options positions and stock positions hedged by
  options
- However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the expansion of the program,
  which now allows portfolio margins to be used for equity securities as well
- Note that portfolio margin can only be used for equities, options, or derivatives positions used
  as hedges. It cannot be used for bond positions

#### Portfolio Margin Basis

- The basis for the margin requirement is to "stress test" securities positions by applying
  probability-based loss percentages, based on historical volatility of both the security itself and
  the overall market
- Based on this, portfolio margins generally result in overall lower margin requirements and greater
  leverages

#### Maximum Portfolio Margin

- For most equities, the maximum portfolio margin is 15%, as opposed to 50% under Reg T
- If the position is deemed to be "concentrated" — too large a percentage of the portfolio is in a
  single security — the margin is doubled to 30%
- (Note: Do not be concerned about memorizing these percentages; you only need to know the general
  concept for the exam.)

#### Only Sophisticated Investors Qualify

- Only sophisticated customers are eligible for these dramatically lowered margin requirements:
  - **$100,000 Equity for Individual Accounts**: Individual customers must maintain a minimum
    account equity of $100,000
  - **$500,000 Equity for Prime Brokerage Accounts**: Prime brokerage accounts must maintain a
    minimum account equity of $500,000
  - **$5,000,000 for Accounts with Unlisted Derivatives or Day-Trading Accounts**: Customers who are
    not broker-dealers or futures firms that wish to carry unlisted derivatives or conduct day
    trading must maintain a minimum account equity of $5,000,000

#### Prior Approval of FINRA to Offer Portfolio Margin

- Any brokerage firm that wishes to offer portfolio margins must get approval from FINRA to do so,
  and the firm must demonstrate that it has the sophisticated computer systems in place necessary to
  compute and monitor these margin requirements on a real-time, intraday basis

#### Margin Deficiency Must Be Paid in 3 Business Days

- If a portfolio margin account has a margin deficiency at the end of the day, FINRA rules require
  that payment to meet the margin call is to be received within 3 business days

#### Individual Customers Must Be Sophisticated

- FINRA has applied the following rules to open portfolio margin accounts for individual customers:
  - **Minimum $100,000 Equity for Individual Customers**: The account must be established
    exclusively as a portfolio margin account and must have minimum equity of $100,000
  - **Account Approved for Naked Options Writing by ROP**: The account must be approved for
    uncovered options writing (applicable only to sophisticated customers). This also means that a
    Series 4 principal cannot approve these accounts. Approval is done by a registered options
    principal (ROP), either Series 4 or Series 9 licensed
  - **Portfolio Margin Risk Disclosure Statement**: The customer must receive a Portfolio Margin
    Risk Disclosure Statement at or before the first transaction in the account. This document
    explains how portfolio margins are calculated, how lower margins can increase the risk of loss,
    and other related considerations
  - **Customer Must Acknowledge Reading the Risk Disclosure Statement**: The customer must sign an
    acknowledgment stating that they have read the Portfolio Margin Risk Disclosure Statement,
    understand its contents, and agree to abide by its provisions

---

### Topic 6: Margin on Options and Leveraged ETFs

#### Margin on Long Options

- **Deposit 100% of Premium**
- For options (except Reg T) requires that 100% of the premium be deposited. The option is fully
  paid, and no loans are permitted against the long option (which makes sense since the contract
  expires at a set date within the coming months)
- Minimum maintenance requirements do not apply since the long positions are fully paid

#### This treatment is the same whether a short call, long call, options put, interest rate option, or foreign currency option is purchased

#### LEAPS

- LEAPS: Deposit 75% of Premium, When LEAPS Are within 9 Months of Expiration = Deposit 100%
- Regarding Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS), which have initial expirations from
  28-36 months in the future, Reg T requires that 75% of the premium be deposited
- This is also the minimum requirement. When LEAPS are within 9 months of expiration (the same as a
  regular option), 100% of the premium must be deposited

#### Margin on Covered Stock Options

##### Short Call Covered by Ownership of Stock: No Margin on Call, Only on Long Stock

- If a stock call is "covered," there is no margin on the call itself. A short call is covered if
  the customer buys the stock. Of course, they had to pay for the stock position: depositing 100% if
  it was bought in a cash account or 50% if it was bought in a margin account
- If the customer is exercised, they simply deliver the stock she/he/they own

##### Short Put Covered by Short Stock Position

- For margin purposes, a short put is considered covered if the customer has a short stock position
  in the same stock
- The customer cannot lose on the short put. If the market keeps falling, it will have an offsetting
  profit on the short stock position
- However, please remember that this customer will be unlimited in their potential loss on the short
  stock position
- The customer must deposit the margin on the short stock position. Once the short stock position is
  properly margined, there is no margin requirement on the short put, so no margin is required on
  that position

##### No Margin on Short Put, Only on Short Stock Position

- The customer must deposit the margin on the short stock position. Once the short stock position is
  properly margined, there is no margin requirement on the short put. This means options can only be
  performed in a margin account as short stock positions are only available in margin accounts

#### Examples of Covered Put-Option Margins

**Example 1**: A customer has a short position of 100 shares of ABC in a margin account. The
customer sells 1 ABC Jan 50 Put @ $3. What is the margin requirement? What is the margin deposit?
**Answer**: The customer has a short stock position. The stock position covers the short put, so no
margin is required. The customer receives $300 in premiums.

**Example 2**: On the same day in a margin account, a customer shorts 100 shares of ABC at $50 and
sells 1 ABC Jan 50 Put @ $3. What is the margin requirement? What is the margin deposit? **Answer**:
To buy the short stock, the customer is required to deposit 50% of $5,000, or $2,500. The short
position covers the put, so no margin is required on that position. Since the customer receives $300
of premiums in the account, the cash deposit is $2,200.

**Example 3**: On the same day in a margin account, a customer shorts 100 shares of ABC at $50 and
sells 1 ABC Jan 50 Put @ $3 at $50. **Answer**: To buy the short stock, the customer is required to
deposit 50% of $5,000, or $2,500. The ownership of the stock covers the put, so no margin is
required on that position. Since the customer receives $300 of premiums in the account, the cash
deposit is $2,200.

#### Margin on Straddles and Spreads

##### Straddle (Depost Combined Premiums)

- If a customer buys a straddle, they are buying an identical call and put on the same stock
  position. Because the customer is buying the contracts, they must deposit 100% of the premiums

##### Example

- When the market price of ABC stock is $51, a customer buys the following straddle:
  - Buy 1 ABC Jan 50 Call @ $3
  - Buy 1 ABC Jan 50 Put @ $4
- The customer must deposit the total premium of $3 premium + $4 premium, or $700 to buy the
  straddle. Also note that this is the maximum loss for the customer

##### Note: Deposits on short straddles are not tested

#### Margin on Spreads

- Spreads are gain-limiting and risk-limiting positions — where the customer buys and sells a
  contract on the same security, with different strike prices or expirations. In each case of a
  margin is that a customer can not be required to put up more than they can lose
- In a **debit spread**, the maximum loss is the difference between the strike prices minus the net
  credit (if it is a credit spread). This is the most that can be lost on the spread
- In a **credit spread**, the maximum loss is the difference between the strike prices minus the
  credit. This is the most that can be lost on the short spread

##### Example 1

- A customer takes the following position:
  - Buy 1 ABC Jan 50 Call @ $5
  - Sell 1 ABC Jan 55 Call @ $3
- This is a long call spread because the long call has the higher premium, resulting in a net debit
  of $2. The deposit is the debit of $2 ($200), which is the maximum potential loss.

##### Example 2

- A customer takes the following position:
  - Sell 1 ABC Jan 50 Call @ $5
  - Buy 1 ABC Jan 55 Call @ $3
- This is a short call spread because the short call has the higher premium, resulting in a net
  credit of $2. The deposit is the difference in the strike prices (5 points) minus the net credit
  of $2 points = $300 (represented as the maximum potential value of the $500 collected in premium,
  which equals $300). This is the most that can be lost on the short spread.

#### Leveraged ETFs "Multiply" Returns Using Derivatives

- Leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a subset of traditional ETFs that are designed to
  generate multiples (e.g., 200%, 300%) of the performance of the underlying index or sector they
  track
- Some of these are "short" or "inverse" leveraged ETFs, because they seek to deliver performance
  that is exactly the opposite of the index they track (underperforming with rises, overperforming
  when declining). Including options, futures, and swaps, to multiply their returns. However, this
  also means that their price swings can be dramatic

#### FINRA's Concern with Leveraged ETFs

- FINRA's concern is that the increased volatility associated with these products means that
  traditional strategy-based margin will not sufficiently account for the expected risk. Intraday
  losses can exceed what a normal margin requirement provides
- As a result, the FINRA Board of Governors can request that leveraged ETFs maintain more than the
  normal margin requirement

#### Minimum Margin Requirement Is Multiplied by the ETF's Leverage

##### Example 1

- A customer wants to purchase 100 shares of ABC ETF at $200 per share. This ETF has 200% leverage.
  The Reg T requirement is 50% of $20,000, or $10,000. However, FINRA sets a minimum margin equal to
  3 times the 25% minimum, which equals 75% of $20,000 = $15,000. The customer must deposit $15,000,
  which is also the minimum maintenance requirement on the same.

##### Example 2

- A customer wants to purchase 100 shares of XYZ ETF at $40 per share. This ETF has 300% leverage.
  The Reg T requirement is 50% of $4,000, or $2,000. However, FINRA sets a minimum margin equal to 3
  times the 25% minimum, which equals 75% of $4,000 = $3,000. In this case, the Reg T requirement
  and the FINRA minimum maintenance requirement are the same.

### Topic 7: Opening a Margin Account

#### Cash vs. Margin Account Opening

- To open a cash account, only the new account form is required. In a cash account, the customer
  agrees to pay in full for all purchases
- To open a margin account, additional documentation is required. A principal must approve all
  accounts

#### The Margin Agreement

- Before opening a margin account, the customer must sign a **margin agreement**. The margin
  agreement sets the terms and conditions between the customer and the broker-dealer
- The agreement has three parts: a **hypothecation agreement**, a **credit agreement**, and a **loan
  consent agreement**

#### Hypothecation Agreement

- Under this agreement, the customer pledges (hypothecates) the securities that are purchased in the
  account to the brokerage firm
- The firm will hold the securities in **street name** (registered in the name of the firm)
- The agreement allows the broker-dealer to sell the securities if the account falls below the
  minimum maintenance requirement
- Holding the securities in street name makes them easier for the broker-dealer to sell

#### Rehypothecation

- The firm also has the right to repledge (rehypothecate) the securities to a bank to raise funds
- The Federal Reserve controls lending by banks to broker-dealers under **Regulation U (Reg U)**
- Funds are borrowed from the bank by the brokerage firm at the **broker's call** (or **call loan
  rate**)
- The call loan rate is the rate at which banks lend money to broker-dealers to fund the margin
  loans that brokers extend to their customers

#### Test-Taking Tip

- Borrowing between banks and brokers is covered under Reg U. Borrowing between brokers and their
  customers is covered under Reg T

#### Credit Agreement

- This agreement sets the terms and conditions of the loan
- A typical margin agreement will state that interest on the loan balance will be based on the
  broker loan rate (e.g., call loan rate plus 2%)

#### Loan Consent Agreement

- This agreement allows broker-dealers to lend out a customer's margined securities to other
  customers for short-selling purposes
- This agreement is **not required**, but it is typically part of the margin agreement

#### Special Disclosure for Pattern Day-Trading Accounts

- Before opening the account, the member firm must give the customer a disclosure statement that
  states:
  - Day trading can be extremely risky
  - Be wary of exaggerated claims about the potential profits of day trading
  - Day trading requires knowledge of the securities markets and the firm's operations
  - Day trading will generate substantial commissions to the firm promoting the strategy
  - Day trading on margin can result in losses greater than one's investment
  - Persons who day trade for others must be registered as an investment adviser or a broker-dealer

#### Credit and Risk Disclosure Statements

- Alongside the margin agreement, noninstitutional customers opening a margin account must be given
  a **credit disclosure statement** as well as a **margin risk disclosure statement** explaining the
  risks of margin trading
- This disclosure must be redelivered to margin customers annually

#### Customer Signature

- **Customer signature is required**: The customer must sign the margin agreement at or before the
  settlement of the first trade in the account

## Section 2: Fiduciary Accounts

### Introduction

- A fiduciary account is one where a third party acts for, and in the best interest of, the account
  owner
- Types of fiduciary accounts include:
  - Custodial accounts
  - Guardian accounts
  - Trust accounts

---

### Topic 1: Requirements for Fiduciary Accounts

#### Papers Appointing Fiduciary

- Generally, fiduciary accounts cannot be opened unless the proper documentation appointing the
  fiduciary is received by the firm
- Since the fiduciary is a third party handling the account, only they are permitted to trade in the
  account
- The fiduciary cannot give trading authorization to another person (unless the account
  documentation permits this, such as allowing an outside registered investment adviser [RIA] to
  manage the account)

#### Cash Accounts Only

- Fiduciary accounts are generally prohibited from margin transactions — only cash accounts are
  permitted
- To open a margin account for a fiduciary, the documents appointing the fiduciary must specifically
  authorize margin transactions

#### Prudent Person Rule

- Each state often limits fiduciaries in the types of investments that can be made
- State law requires that fiduciaries either follow the **prudent person rule** or restrict
  investments to a list of legal investments (**legal list**) provided by the state
- Aggressive options strategies, such as naked call writing, are prohibited
- Conservative options strategies, such as covered call writing and buying protective puts, are
  permissible
- Under the prudent person rule, only investments that a prudent individual would make are permitted
- If the state restricts investments to its legal list, then only the securities on the list are
  available for investment

#### Power of Attorney

- A power of attorney (POA) is not a type of account but is used to grant authorization to a third
  party
- A full POA allows for trading as well as the ability to make withdrawals
- A power of attorney can be either **durable** or **nondurable**
- If the grantor of a durable POA becomes mentally incompetent, the person to whom power of attorney
  was granted retains control over the account
- With a nondurable POA, if the grantor becomes mentally incompetent, the power ceases
- Also note that any POA terminates upon the death of the grantor
- Note that an incarcerated individual — a person in prison — can still grant a POA to someone to
  manage their financial affairs

---

### Topic 2: Types of Fiduciary Accounts (Custodial Accounts)

#### Custodial Accounts

- Custodial accounts are accounts where a third party manages the account on behalf of a
  beneficiary, often a minor
- These accounts are sometimes referred to as fiduciary accounts because the third party must manage
  the account in the best interest of the beneficiary and put the beneficiary's interests before
  their own

#### UGMA and UTMA

- Two custodial accounts may appear on the test: **Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)** and
  **Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)**
- These custodial accounts require an adult to open and manage the account on behalf of a minor
- There can be only one custodian and one minor. The minor and custodian do not need to be related,
  but the custodian must be an adult
- The minor is the official owner of the account and its assets; the custodian is responsible for
  managing the account
- These accounts are not joint accounts, as all assets are the property of the minor

#### Custodian Rules

- Custodians have third-party trading authorization, allowing them to make trades in the accounts
- Because minors are not old enough to make trades, they cannot trade in the account
- Dividends, interest, and capital gains in UGMA/UTMA accounts are considered unearned income

#### Tax Treatment (Kiddie Tax)

- The account must be opened under the minor's Social Security number
- A portion of the earnings will be taxable at the minor's rate. Above this amount, the
  parent's/guardian's tax rate will apply
- Regardless of the rate, the taxes due are the child's responsibility. These rules are often
  referred to as the **kiddie tax**

#### Irrevocable Gifts

- Gifts can be made to the account by other adults; however, all gifts are **irrevocable**, meaning
  they cannot be withdrawn or reversed once they have been given
- Gifts can be either cash or fully paid securities

#### Death of Minor

- Assets in the account will be transferred to the minor's estate in the case of the death of the
  minor, rather than passing directly to the parents

#### Fiduciary Duty of Custodian

- The custodian of an account has a fiduciary duty to the minor on that account, which means that
  the custodian must put the minor's interests before their own. Several rules related to this
  fiduciary duty include:
  - Custodians are obligated to follow the prudent person rule, which means that they must invest
    according to a set of prudent investment portfolio standards
  - Custodians may withdraw funds from accounts to use for the benefit of the minors or to reimburse
    expenses. All withdrawals and uses of the funds must be documented
  - The account must be a cash account. Custodians may not purchase securities on margin in
    accounts. (They must pay 100% of their purchase and may not borrow money for the purchase from
    the broker-dealer.)
  - Custodians or member firms may not use securities held in accounts as collateral on a loan
  - Custodians must reinvest any cash earned in accounts within a reasonable amount of time
  - Custodians may not write naked calls in accounts
  - Minors may sue custodians for mismanagement of their accounts
  - Margin may not be used in these accounts

#### UGMA Accounts

- Under UGMA, full rights to the assets in an account are transferred over to the minor once the
  minor reaches the age of majority in their state of residence
- However, the minor is always the legal owner of the account, and the account will be opened using
  the minor's Social Security number or tax ID number
- Investments in UGMA accounts are limited to financial assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.).
  Investments cannot be made into real estate, collectibles, or uncovered derivative products (e.g.,
  options)

#### UTMA Accounts

- UTMA accounts are similar to UGMA accounts, although UTMA accounts can include a broader range of
  assets, including real estate
- Additionally, a UTMA account allows the custodian to delay the transfer of assets beyond the age
  of majority, but no later than the age of 25. Actual age limits will vary by state
- Do not confuse UGMA/UTMA accounts with Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts, which
  are designed to allow people with disabilities and their families to save for the future. An ABLE
  account can be established for either a child or an adult, provided that they have a disability
  that began before the age of 46

#### Guardian Account

- A legal guardian is a person appointed by a court to protect the assets of a minor or an
  incompetent adult
- To open a guardian account, the firm must obtain a copy of the court order appointing the guardian
- The account cannot be opened only in the name of a minor or an incompetent adult

---

### Topic 3: Trust Accounts

#### Overview

- Trust accounts are most commonly used to help individuals ensure the smooth passing of their
  assets to their heirs upon death
- They may also be used to minimize possible estate and inheritance taxes or to provide for a minor
  child or a loved one with a disability

#### Key Parties

- The person who sets up the trust and puts assets into it is called the **grantor** (also known as
  the trustor, donor, or settlor)
- The person appointed to manage the assets is called the **trustee**
- The person who will eventually receive the assets is the **beneficiary**

#### Beneficiaries

- A beneficiary can be a minor, an adult, or a mentally incompetent adult
- Like estate accounts, trust accounts are considered custodial accounts because the trustee is
  managing the account on behalf of the beneficiaries
- The trustee will have trading authority in the account, but a third party could also have trading
  authority if the individual is listed in the trust agreement

#### Trust Agreement

- When opening a trust account, the firm must obtain a copy of the **trust agreement**
- The agreement will specify the types of transactions that the trustee is authorized to perform
- These accounts cannot be margin accounts unless specifically authorized by the trust agreement

#### Types of Trust Accounts

##### Revocable vs. Irrevocable Trusts

- The most common form of trust account is a **revocable living trust**, which is a trust that can
  be revoked (eliminated) at any time prior to death by the person who owns the assets (the trustor)
- If the trust is revoked, ownership of the assets reverts back to the person to whom they
  originally belonged

##### Note on Trustee

- The trustee (not the trustor or beneficiaries) is responsible for managing the trust, regardless
  of who originally set up the trust
- However, the grantor may appoint themselves as the trustee

##### Irrevocable Trusts

- Once **irrevocable trusts** are set up, they cannot be undone or revoked
- In fact, they typically are given their own tax identification numbers and are treated as separate
  taxpayers for tax purposes
- Any income earned within a trust is subject to annual taxation

##### Key Tax Difference

- Again, the trustee — not the grantor or the beneficiaries — is the person from whom a
  representative must ultimately take instructions regarding the account
- The trustee must follow the instructions listed in the trust agreement or will
- Perhaps the most important difference between a revocable and an irrevocable trust is that
  **assets put into an irrevocable trust will not be included in the grantor's estate for estate tax
  purposes**
- In contrast, **assets put into a revocable trust are included in the trustor's estate for tax
  purposes**
- For both revocable and irrevocable trusts, the trustee is considered a fiduciary and must put the
  beneficiary's interests before their own. They are also responsible for prudent management of the
  assets within the trust

##### Living vs. Testamentary Trusts

- **Living trusts**: Created while a person is living
- **Testamentary trusts**: Initiated upon a person's death, according to the terms of a will. The
  terms of the trust generally state that property will be put into a trust for beneficiaries at the
  time of death. The instructions will be carried out by a trustee
- Testamentary trusts do not avoid probate because a court must substantiate the claims within the
  will

##### Charitable Trusts

- A **charitable trust** is used for customers who want to leave part of or all their estate to a
  charity
- A **charitable remainder trust (CRT)** can be set up so that assets are given to the charity
  before the donor's death, but the donor receives a fixed amount of income from the assets
  periodically until death
- After death, the remainder of the assets belong to the charity
- A CRT is irrevocable

---

## Section 3: Joint, Business, and Options Accounts

### Introduction

- Several other types of accounts may be tested
- Joint accounts involve more than one owner
- Business accounts can be set up for partnerships, corporations, or investment advisers who are
  managing accounts on behalf of their customers
- Options accounts are typically set up as individual accounts under rules established by the
  Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)

---

### Topic 1: Joint Accounts

#### General Rules

- If more than one party is named on the account, new account information must be obtained for each
  party
- All parties are allowed access to the account and may make trades independently
- Any checks issued must be payable to all parties on the account
- Social Security numbers are collected from each owner, but (surprisingly) joint accounts report
  taxable events under a primary tax identification number, which belongs to one of the owners
- Each owner is responsible for their respective tax bill
- In many cases, each party simply claims half of the liability for any gains or losses from the
  account

#### Two Types of Joint Account Ownership

1. **Joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS)**: Each party owns an undivided interest in
   the account. JTWROS accounts bypass probate, which is a time-consuming and sometimes expensive
   process of settling a will in a court. If one party dies, the other person becomes the sole owner
   of the account. This ownership option is most common for a married couple.

2. **Tenancy in common**: Each party specifies a percentage interest in the account. If a person
   dies, their percentage interest in the property passes to their estate. It can then be passed via
   a will to any named person. This ownership option is most commonly used by business partners.

#### Transfer-on-Death (TOD)

- **Transfer-on-death (TOD)** is not an account type but rather a way to pass an account to a
  beneficiary
- TOD registration allows the owner to keep complete control over the account
- Then the registration transfers to the name of the beneficiary upon the owner's death
- Similar to a JTWROS account, a TOD designation also avoids probate

---

### Topic 2: Business Accounts

#### Corporate Account

- To open an account for a corporation, the firm needs to receive a copy of the **corporate
  resolution**
- The resolution must permit accounts to remain open and designate the individuals with trading
  authorization
- A corporate tax identification number must be obtained
- Firms may also require a copy of the corporate charter

#### Limited Liability Company (LLC) Account

- A **limited liability company (LLC)** is an entity that combines the benefits of a sole
  proprietorship or partnership with those of a corporation
- Starting an LLC requires filing articles of organization with the secretary of state of any state
  in which they operate
- The articles require a statement of purpose and the firm's expected duration (an LLC may exist
  perpetually or have a specific termination date when it will cease to exist)
- The company will also typically be required to pay initial and annual fees
- To open an account, an LLC must provide a copy of their articles or certificate of organization
- Identification and signatures are required; however, if the LLC has only one member, that member's
  Social Security number can be used in place of an employer's identification number

#### Partnership Account

- To open a partnership account, the firm needs to obtain a copy of the **partnership agreement**
- Like a corporate resolution, the partnership agreement must allow for the opening of the account
  and name the partners authorized to trade in the account

#### Investment Adviser Account

- An investment adviser is a person or entity that provides investment advice to individuals for a
  fee
- Investment advisers are considered fiduciaries and must therefore put their customers' interests
  before their own
- An investment adviser account is typically held in the customer's name, but the investment adviser
  has discretionary authority and makes most of the trades in the account
- When an adviser has many customers, the adviser might open an **omnibus account**, which is an
  account held in the adviser's name, and which contains all its customers' securities
- To open an omnibus account, the investment adviser must fill out individual new account forms for
  each customer, along with a third-party trading authorization, as the customer is granting power
  of attorney to the investment adviser

#### Wrap Account

- A **wrap account** provides investment advice as well as a certain number of brokerage
  transactions in a single account
- The investment adviser trades the accounts for the clients, charging them an annual management fee
- Confirmations of trades and statements are sent to both the customer and the investment adviser
- Wrap accounts are defined as an advisory product because they charge either a flat fee or a fee
  based on a percentage of assets
- To offer advisory products, a representative is required to be dually registered as a FINRA
  broker-dealer representative and a **registered investment adviser (RIA)** representative

#### Institutional Account

- An institutional account is an account held by a bank, investment company, registered investment
  adviser, or any other business or individual with total assets of at least **$50 million**
- Institutional accounts are generally considered to be sophisticated investors who do not need the
  level of protection provided to retail investors
- The suitability obligation for an institutional account is fulfilled if:
  - The broker-dealer has a reasonable basis to believe that the institutional customer is capable
    of evaluating risk independently
  - The customer affirms that it is exercising independent judgment when evaluating the
    broker-dealer's recommendations

---

### Topic 3: Options Accounts

#### Cboe Requirements

- Cboe has its requirements for opening a new account. These requirements are like FINRA
  requirements, with a few differences

#### Required Information for Options Account

- To open an options account, the customer must be asked specifically about the following items:
  - Investment objective
  - Investment experience
  - Financial situation
  - Financial needs
  - Marital status
  - Net worth
  - Liquid net worth
  - Estimated annual income

#### Refusal to Disclose

- **Note**: If the customer refuses to disclose any of this information, then the registered
  representative must note "not disclosed" for each such item. In this case, the CBOE states that it
  is up to the approving manager to decide whether the account should be opened

#### Options Agreement

- Cboe requires that the customer be sent a copy of the **options agreement**
- By signing, the customer agrees to abide by any trading restrictions imposed by the member firm
  and also agrees to comply with OCC rules (e.g., position limits, exercise limits)
- Cboe also requires that if the customer's financial situation changes materially, the options
  agreement must be amended to reflect this change

#### Account Approval

- The registered representative must sign the new account form, indicating that the information on
  the form is true and accurate
- After assessing the investor's suitability for options trading, a **registered options principal
  (ROP)** must approve in writing the customer's account for options transactions
- A FINRA-registered **branch office manager (BOM)** may initially approve an options account;
  however, ultimate approval must come from a registered options principal (ROP)

#### Options Disclosure Document (ODD)

- In addition, the customer must be given an **options disclosure document (ODD)** that was created
  by the OCC
- This disclosure document must be delivered by the date of the principal's approval

#### Return of Signed Options Agreement

- Once the account is approved, the customer may begin trading
- However, the customer must return the signed options agreement to the firm no later than **15
  days** after the account is opened
- If the agreement is not received from the customer within 15 days, the customer cannot open any
  new positions, but they may close out any open positions
- If the agreement is subsequently received, the restriction on the account is removed

#### Options Accounts for Associated Persons

- If a representative of another firm wishes to open an options account at another member firm, they
  must first receive written approval from their employer to do so
- If the account is approved, all statements and confirmations will be automatically sent to the
  employing broker-dealer
