## Raw Notes from Source Material

---

## SECTION 1: The Securities Exchange Act of 1934

### Introduction
- Securities Act of 1933 = PRIMARY market (new issues)
- Securities Exchange Act of 1934 = SECONDARY market (existing securities trading)
- Key difference: The '34 Act's anti-fraud provisions apply to EVERYONE (both exempt and nonexempt issuers/investors, anyone who fraudulently deals in ANY security)

### Key Concepts to Know
1. Creation of the SEC and Market Manipulation Rules
2. Insider Rules
3. Issuer, Exchange, and Member Firm Registration and Requirements

---

## Topic 1: Creation of the SEC and Market Manipulation Rules

### The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)
- Created by the 1934 Act
- Principal FEDERAL regulatory agency for securities industry
- Writes rules and regulations that give teeth to securities laws
- Enforces compliance with CIVIL and CRIMINAL penalties
- Regulates NONEXEMPT securities only
- Does NOT regulate:
  - General account insurance products
  - Commodities
  - Futures contracts
  - Exempt securities (U.S. Treasury, municipal bonds)

### TEST TIP: No parties are exempt from the anti-fraud provisions of the '34 Act

### Prohibited Activities (Market Manipulation)
The '34 Act outlaws market manipulation. Unlawful practices include:

1. **Front Running** - Dealer placing an order ahead of a pending customer order (especially large block orders)

2. **Trading Ahead** - Trading ahead of customer limit orders (similar to front running) OR trading ahead of a firm's yet-to-be-released research report

3. **Painting the Tape** - Trading a security to create the impression of rising or falling prices

4. **False or Misleading Statements** - Using false/misleading statements to sell a security
   - Pump and Dump scheme - "pumping" up price through hype/rumors, then "dumping" shares at inflated price
   - Accepting payment to spread rumors about price movement
   - Pegging the price (preventing it from falling) in the market OTHER than under strict SEC rules (like for new issue stabilization)

### Manipulation = FRAUD
- Illegal to use deception or manipulation to get customers to buy a security
- Rule applies to BOTH exempt AND nonexempt securities

### Civil Lawsuits
- Guilty parties may be liable for civil damages by investors
- Suits must be brought within 2 years of discovery
- But no later than 5 years after the violation occurred

---

## Topic 2: Insider Rules

### Who is an "Insider"?
Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, an insider is:
- Officer
- Director, and/or
- 10% shareholder of an issuer's equity securities

### Insider Rules (What Insiders Must Follow)
1. Prohibited from trading based on **Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)**
2. Any **short swing profits** (profits from purchase AND sale of company's stock within six months) are NOT allowed - must be paid back to issuer
3. Prohibited from selling their own company's stock short (Note: Buying protective puts IS allowed)
4. Must report trades within **2 business days** to the SEC, which makes the information public

### Insider Trading Definition
- Expanded to include ANY person who has received **Material Nonpublic Information (MNPI)**
- MNPI = information NOT released to public AND expected to influence security price
- Once news media releases information, it's no longer nonpublic and traders are not subject to insider trading rules
- It's UNLAWFUL for anyone who gains MNPI and knows it's confidential to trade on such information
- It's ALSO unlawful to pass on inside information that is then traded on
- BOTH the tipper and tippee are liable for prosecution

### Example
An employee of a broker-dealer learns material nonpublic information about a publicly traded company at an after-hours work party. He tells his cousin about the stock and tells the cousin to buy it. The cousin buys and makes a profit. BOTH the employee (tipper) and cousin (tippee) are liable for insider trading. If no trade had occurred, neither would be guilty.

### Important Note
Falsely claiming a recommendation is based on MNPI is NOT insider trading, but it IS still a violation (deceptive practice). Recommendations based on rumors or unverified information would also be a violation.

### Information Barriers
- Firms must create policies/procedures known as **information barriers** to control information flow
- Example: Investment bankers working on takeover bid - company identity may only be known to one or two top people, and all communications use pseudonyms
- Stock analysts are NOT allowed to share information with brokers until made public

### Violations for Insider Trading
Violators may receive:
- Civil penalties
- Criminal penalties, or
- BOTH

**Civil penalties**: Up to 3x the profit realized or loss avoided ("Treble" damages - old-fashioned word for triple)

**Criminal penalties for individuals**:
- Fine of up to $5 million for each inside trade
- Up to 20 years in jail for each violation
- Firms cannot be jailed but may receive criminal fine up to $25 million

**Informant rewards**: 10%-30% of amounts recovered above $1 million
- Private parties have right to sue persons who violated insider trading rules
- Statute of limitations: 6 years

### Rule 10b5-1 Prearranged Trading Plan
- To avoid liability for insider trading, insiders can establish a **prearranged trading plan**
- This is a **safe-harbor** rule permitting officers, directors, and 10% shareholders to establish a written plan for trading their company's securities
- Plan specifies future date and amount of securities to be bought or sold
- Once plan is in force, insider cannot have any further influence on trades made under the plan

---

## Topic 3: Issuer, Exchange, and Firm Requirements

### Reporting by Corporate Issuers
- '34 Act requires all publicly traded companies to disclose information to the SEC
- This information is available online to public

### 10-Q and 10-K Reports

- Most broker-dealers are required to join FINRA
- All FINRA rules are approved by the SEC

### Broker-Dealer Registration with the SEC
- '34 Act requires most broker-dealers to register with SEC and join FINRA
- SEC can censure, suspend, or revoke registration
- SEC-registered broker-dealers must comply with:

1. **Net Capital Rule**: Firms must meet minimum capital standards to maintain registration and report net capital to the SEC
   - Clearing broker-dealers hold customer funds/securities - have HIGHER net capital requirements
   - Introducing broker-dealers contract with clearing broker-dealer to hold customers' funds/securities - have LOWER net capital requirements

2. **Notification of Broker-Dealer Financial Condition**: Brokerage firms must send customers semiannual financial statements including:
   - Balance sheet (audited for year-end; unaudited for mid-year)
   - Net capital computation showing broker-dealer's net capital

### TEST TIP: Broker-dealers are NOT required to provide income statements to their customers

## SECTION 2: Other Securities Laws and Regulations

### Introduction
- Since the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act, Congress and federal regulators have created several new laws and regulations to protect investors and ensure fair markets

### Key Concepts
1. Other Federal Regulations
2. State Regulations

---

## Topic 1: Other Securities Laws

### Trust Indenture Act of 1939
- Bonds from all companies that issue more than $50 million of interstate debt securities (sold across state lines) must:
  - Use an indenture (contract with provisions to be followed by the issuer and trustee)
  - Have a trustee appointed to protect bondholder interests
- If company is not meeting its debt obligations, trustee takes legal action on behalf of bondholders
- Trust Indenture Act applies only to corporate bond offerings of more than $50 million - does NOT extend to:

**Borrowing for Shares and Bonds**: Mutual funds may borrow up to 1/3 of total assets to purchase additional securities, and must maintain 300% asset coverage (3x debt level)

**Diversification of Assets**: Most funds choose to be diversified
- 75% of fund's assets = no more than 5% in any single company's securities
- 25% can be invested in whatever they want

- Securities of companies undergoing reorganization (if it makes fund > 10% owner)

**Prohibited Transactions**: SEC Rule 17a-7 prohibits the sale of stock by a fund to another fund with the same adviser (prevents manipulating NAV at investor expense)

**Types of Diversification**: Aside from diversified funds, there are:
- Diversified common stock funds
- Specialized or sector funds
- Non-diversified funds

**Composition of Board of Directors**
- Management investment companies must have a board of directors (BOD)

- BOD acts as "watchdog" over fund and protects shareholder interests
- The board designates responsibility for:
  - Fund's day-to-day management
  - Appointing officers/agents for operations
  - Executing contracts
  - Handling other BOD duties

**40% of BOD Must be "Disinterested"**: Under the act, at least 40% of the BOD must be "independent" (not associated with the fund) - under the fund company, any dealer, and any "affiliated person" (i.e., within company hierarchy) cannot be on the disinterested portion of the board

**Affiliated Persons**: Officers are interested persons who are likely to influence decisions in favor of:
- Distributor/dealer (sponsor)
- Custodian (bank)

**Note about majority**: Fund companies of at least 40% of disinterested members are required
**No Indebtedness** from directors = required (directors need to be independent/no debts to fund company)
- If all conditions are met, there is a majority

**Approving Investment Advisory Contracts with Vote**
Management fees paid to the fund adviser must be approved
- Management fees are recommended annually based on performance vs peer group
- The adviser can be terminated with only 60 days' notice to any person

**Approving Distribution/Sales Contract**

### Prohibited Fund Practices: Securities Sold on Margin and Mutual Funds Cannot Buy on Margin (Futures, Real Estate, Reorganization Issues)

### Investment Advisers Act of 1940

- Taking discretionary authority: Cannot transfer funds from one client account to another

### Regulation Best Interest
- Under Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), broker-dealers have duty to act in best interest of customer when making recommendations and cannot place their own financial interests above customer
- Conflict of interest regulation for Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) also has some overlapping rules

### Regulation S-P
- Governs how broker-dealers and investment advisers handle private customer nonpublic personal information
- Companies must have written policies to keep customer nonpublic information (NPI) secure
- Must send privacy policy notice to customers for review
- Under Regulation S-P, customers have right to "opt out" of having certain NPI shared with nonaffiliated third parties

### Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)
- SIPC was created in 1970 to protect customers of broker-dealers that fail
- Most broker-dealers are members
- SIPC protects customers' securities and cash when BD fails
- Does NOT protect customers from investment losses based on market decline or fraud from BD or agent

### SIPC Coverage
- Securities registered in customer's name returned without limits
- Cash, margin debits - covered up to $500,000 per customer
- Cash-only portion: Up to $250,000

### Example
An investor has an account with $200,000 in securities and a $100,000 cash balance with their broker-dealer.
- ANSWER: The entire value is covered. $200,000 securities + $100,000 cash = $300,000 total (under $500,000 limit and cash under $250,000 sublimit)

At time of broker-dealer's failure, all losses above SIPC coverage become general creditor claims against the estate.

### Additional Coverage (Excess SIPC)
- Many BDs buy excess SIPC policies to cover additional customer assets
- Coverage is typically greater $25,000,000. That's an additional policy. Overall more than SIPC max

### Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

  - Stocks, bonds, or mutual funds
  - Annuity contracts
  - Life insurance policies
  - U.S. Treasury securities
  - Municipal bonds

### TEST TIP: FDIC provides deposit insurance. Uninvested cash in a brokerage account (in money market or sweep accounts) may be eligible for pass-through FDIC insurance when the deposit is held at an FDIC member bank

### Fingerprinting

## Topic 2: Other Securities Regulations

### Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure)
- Requires that if material nonpublic information is released selectively (only to certain analysts, etc.), it must be released to public broadly
- Promotes fair disclosure to all investors
- REG FD prohibits issuers from selectively disclosing sensitive information about their business

### Regulation SHO (Short Sale Rule)
- Governs short sales
- Requires settlement in locate with Regulation SHO ("Reg SHO")

**Locate Requirement**: Before executing short sale, broker must have "reasonable grounds" to believe the security can be borrowed and delivered on settlement date

**Easy-to-Borrow List**: Updated daily - broker-dealers may rely on this

**Threshold Securities**: Hard-to-Borrow
- If "threshold list" shows (from NSCC) securities are hard to borrow, broker-dealer must locate

**Threshold List**
3 Conditions for being on list:
1. Listed on exchange
2. Open fail-to-deliver position of 10,000 shares or more for 5 consecutive settlement days
3. Open fail equals at least 0.5% of outstanding shares

**Locate requirement waived if**: The seller already has access through broker-dealer to shares

### Sale of Shares to Be Received from Conversion or Exercise (Is a Long Sale)
- Convertible securities conversion = long sale for holder
- Exercise of options = long sale (covered)

**Long Sale Definition**: Sale of Shares Owned by Seller and Delivered on Settlement
- The seller sells stock the seller owns (either in account or known to be available for settlement)
- Sale proceeds at market

**Borrowed Securities' Location Must Be Determined Before Short Sale**
- Under Reg SHO rules, a seller planning to sell short in security must have a definite source of borrowed securities before initiating short sale

**Locate Requirement**
- Generally, the BD rules require a trader selling short to locate specific shares before execution of a short sale on behalf of a customer

**Easy-to-Borrow List: Updated Daily**
- To meet the "reasonable grounds" test, a broker-dealer can rely on an easy-to-borrow list
- If shares are on this list, they can be shorted without further inquiry

**Threshold Securities Are Hard to Borrow**
- If the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC) shows threshold shares, BD must locate shares

**Threshold List**
3 Conditions to be on list:
1. Listed on national exchange
2. Open fail-to-deliver of 10,000+ shares for 5+ consecutive settlement days
3. Open fail equals at least 0.5% of outstanding shares

**Short Sale Definition: Sale of Shares Not Owned by Seller**

Note: If seller owns convertible securities or options, the sale of underlying shares from expected conversion/exercise is considered a long sale (NOT short)

**Sale of Shares to Be Received from Conversion or Exercise Is a Long Sale**
For example: A customer owns ABC Corp convertible bonds. Customer tells BD to sell the common stock of ABC and will deliver the shares when they convert the bonds. This is considered a LONG sale (not a short sale).

### Short Sale Rule If Stock Price Falls by 10%
- SHO circuit breaker "alternative uptick rule"
- Triggered when stock drops 10%+ from prior close
- Once triggered, short sales on that security can ONLY be executed at a price above the current national best bid (NBBO)
- Rule remains in effect for rest of day AND entire next day

### Can Only Sell Short Above Best Bid For Rest of the Day and the Entire Next Day
- Once triggered, short sales must be executed at a price above the current national best bid
- Circuit breaker prevents shorts from aggressively driving price down further

### Regulation T
- Fed Regulation T governs the extension of credit to customers by broker-dealers

### Penny Stock Rules
- Penny stocks are defined as:

- You must establish a "net/net relationship" with the price being at least the wholesale price of the stock, or the current bid price, or an offering price consistent with good practice
- You must provide monthly statements containing specific financial information
- May need to wait 2 days before completing the transaction to ensure customer approval

### Regulation Best Interest
- Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) says that broker-dealers have a duty to act in the best interest of their customers when making recommendations
- Cannot place broker-dealer's financial interest ahead of customer's interest
- From broker-dealer perspective, this involves CRS (Customer Relationship Summary)
- Form CRS required for broker-dealers and investment advisers

### Regulation S-P
- Governs how broker-dealers handle private customer nonpublic personal information (NPI)
- Requires written policies and procedures to protect customer information
- Customers must be given opportunity to "opt out" of having their NPI shared with nonaffiliated third parties

### Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)
- Created 1970 to protect customers when broker-dealers fail
- Coverage: Up to $500,000 total per customer
- Cash sublimit: $250,000
- Does NOT protect against market losses or fraud
