# Chapter 3: Additional Bond Features and Risks

*Series 7 Exam Weight: ~8-10 Questions (6%)*

---

## Section 1: Call and Put Features

In 1986, General Motors issued $1.25 billion in bonds with an 8.5% coupon—generous at the time. But by the early 1990s, interest rates had plummeted. GM was stuck paying top dollar while new issuers borrowed at half the rate. That costly lesson is why today virtually every corporate bond includes call provisions. Issuers learned: never lock yourself into high rates without an escape hatch.

### Why This Section Matters

Beyond the basic bond structure covered in Chapter 2, bonds can include special features that significantly affect their value and behavior. Call features benefit issuers; put features benefit investors. Understanding which party benefits—and when they'd exercise these features—is essential for advising clients and passing your exam.

---

### Topic 1: Bond Call Features

#### What Is a Callable Bond?

When a bond is <span class="key-term">callable</span>, the issuer has the right to <span class="key-term">call</span> (redeem) the bond before it matures. This forces bondholders to sell the bond back to the issuer. Selling a bond back before maturity is known as <span class="key-term">redeeming</span> the bond.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Issuers Want Call Features</div>
  <p>Think about it from the issuer's perspective: if you borrowed money at 8% and rates dropped to 5%, wouldn't you want to refinance? That's exactly what callable bonds allow. The issuer retires the old high-rate debt and issues new bonds at lower rates. It's the corporate equivalent of refinancing your mortgage—except bondholders are on the losing end of that transaction.</p>
</div>

The callable bond's issuer doesn't owe any interest after the bond is redeemed. This is a risk for the bondholder, known as <span class="key-term">call risk</span>. The issuer typically compensates bondholders for call risk in three ways:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">How Issuers Compensate for Call Risk</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher coupon rate</strong> — Callable bonds usually offer higher rates than comparable non-callable bonds</li>
    <li><strong>Call protection period</strong> — A period during which the bond cannot be called (e.g., first 5 years of a 10-year bond)</li>
    <li><strong>Call premium</strong> — An additional amount above par paid when the bond is called</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Call Protection

<span class="key-term">Call protection</span> is a period during which the bond cannot be called. Most callable bonds offer call protection for the first several years.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Call Protection Example</div>
  <p>A 20-year bond issued in 2022 is first callable in 2032.</p>
  <p>The investor has 10 years of call protection—guaranteed interest payments for a decade.</p>
  <p>After 2032, the issuer can call the bond at any time.</p>
</div>

#### Call Premium

A <span class="key-term">call premium</span> is an additional amount paid above par value when a bond is called. Typically, the call premium declines over time as the bond approaches maturity.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Declining Call Premium Schedule</div>
  <p>Bonds issued in 2022, first callable in 2032:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Redemption Date</th>

    <tr>
      <td>2032</td>
      <td>105 ($1,050)</td>

      <td>103 ($1,030)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2035</td>
      <td>102 ($1,020)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2036</td>
      <td>101 ($1,010)</td>

    <tr>
      <td>2037 and after</td>
      <td>100 ($1,000)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### When Do Issuers Call Bonds?

The issuer has the right to call but is not obligated to do so. An issuer will be more likely to call bonds when interest rates fall, because it can issue new bonds at lower rates.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">The Call Process</div>
  <ol>
    <li>The issuer calls the bond</li>
    <li>The issuer pays the bondholder the final interest payment</li>
    <li>The issuer returns the original principal plus any call premium</li>
    <li>The issuer can now sell new bonds at lower interest rates</li>
  </ol>
</div>

(A low call premium also makes a call more likely. If the issuer only has to pay 101 to retire a bond paying 8%, that's a bargain compared to years of above-market interest payments.)

---

### Topic 2: Yield to Call (YTC)

<span class="key-term">Yield to call (YTC)</span> measures how the call feature affects an investor's return. It's important for investors considering buying a callable bond to understand what happens to their return if the issuer decides to call.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> When a recommendation is made, the lesser of yield to maturity (YTM) or YTC must be disclosed to the client so they understand the lowest potential yield. This is often referred to as <span class="key-term">yield to worst (YTW)</span>.</p>
</div>

#### YTC for a Discount Bond

When a bond trades at a discount, YTC is typically <strong>higher</strong> than YTM. Why? Because the investor receives the gain between the discounted price and par value sooner—at the call date rather than at maturity.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Discount Bond Yield Relationship</div>
  <p>For a discount bond (price below par):</p>
  <div style="text-align: center; padding: 1rem; background: var(--fh-gray-100); border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
    <strong>Nominal Yield → Current Yield → Yield to Maturity → Yield to Call</strong>
    <br><em>(lowest to highest)</em>
  </div>
  <p>YTC is highest because the discount is recovered sooner.</p>
</div>

#### YTC for a Premium Bond

When a bond trades at a premium, YTC is typically <strong>lower</strong> than YTM—and this is bad news for investors. Calls on premium bonds hurt investors because they're forced to redeem the bond prior to maturity, losing the attractive higher-coupon payments sooner. The investor also loses the premium paid.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Premium Bond Yield Relationship</div>
  <p>For a premium bond (price above par):</p>
  <div style="text-align: center; padding: 1rem; background: var(--fh-gray-100); border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
    <strong>Yield to Call → Yield to Maturity → Current Yield → Nominal Yield</strong>
    <br><em>(lowest to highest)</em>
  </div>
  <p>YTC is lowest because the premium is lost sooner.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Like YTM, the YTC involves a complicated computation you won't need to perform. But you must understand:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>YTC will be <strong>higher</strong> than YTM for a bond trading at a <strong>discount</strong></li>
    <li>YTC will be <strong>lower</strong> than YTM for a bond trading at a <strong>premium</strong></li>
    <li>YTW for a discount bond will be the YTM</li>
    <li>YTW for a premium bond will be the YTC</li>
  </ul>
</div>

---

### Topic 3: Bond Put Features

A <span class="key-term">put feature</span> gives the investor the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a specified price (typically par), at a specified date. A put option is also called a <span class="key-term">tender option</span>.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Put vs. Call: Who Benefits?</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Who Has the Right?</th>
      <th>Who Benefits?</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Call</strong></td>
      <td>Issuer</td>
      <td>Issuer (can refinance at lower rates)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Put</strong></td>
      <td>Investor</td>
      <td>Investor (can exit at par if rates rise)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### When Do Investors Exercise Put Options?

The bondholder is likely to exercise the put option if interest rates rise. As rates rise, bond prices fall. If the bond's price drops below par, the bondholder can tender the bond to the issuer and receive the full par value. The bondholder can then reinvest the principal into a bond with a higher coupon rate.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Put Feature Example</div>
  <p>A 20-year bond is issued in 2022 with a tender option at par:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Tender Date</th>
      <th>Tender Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2032 and after</td>
      <td>100 ($1,000)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The bondholder has the right to tender the bond to the issuer any time starting in 2032 and receive par value.</p>
</div>

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">The Trade-Off</div>
  <p>The put option sets a floor for the market price during periods of rising interest rates—the price will never drop much below par since the bond can be redeemed at par. From the issuer's perspective, bonds with a put option can be offered with lower coupon rates, saving on interest costs if rates don't rise. Investors accept the lower coupon in exchange for the protection.</p>
</div>

## Section 2: Risks Associated with Bonds

In 2008, Lehman Brothers bondholders learned a brutal lesson: even investment-grade debt can become worthless overnight. The firm's bonds, rated A just months before, recovered only pennies on the dollar in bankruptcy. Understanding the full spectrum of bond risks—not just interest rate movements—is essential for protecting clients.

### Why This Section Matters

Every investment involves risk, but bond risks are specific and testable. The Series 7 exam loves asking about the different types of risk and which investments are most affected by each. This section breaks down every major bond risk you need to know.

---

### Topic 1: Bond Ratings—A Measure of Default Risk

<span class="key-term">Credit risk</span>, also called <span class="key-term">default risk</span>, is the risk that the issuer cannot make interest and principal payments. The two main bond rating agencies for long-term corporate and municipal bonds are <span class="key-term">Moody's</span> and <span class="key-term">Standard & Poor's (S&P)</span>.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Treasury Bonds: No Credit Risk</div>
  <p>Treasury bonds are backed by the U.S. Treasury. They are considered to have no credit risk and carry a AAA rating.</p>
</div>

#### Investment Grade vs. Speculative Grade

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Grade</th>
      <th>Standard & Poor's</th>
      <th>Moody's</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4"><strong>Investment Grade</strong></td>
      <td>AAA</td>
      <td>Aaa</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AA</td>
      <td>Aa</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BBB</td>
      <td>Baa</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4"><strong>Speculative Grade</strong></td>
      <td>BB</td>
      <td>Ba</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CCC</td>
      <td>Caa</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CC, C, D</td>
      <td>Ca, C</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> S&P can adjust a rating slightly by adding a + or - to the rating. The highest rating is AAA, the second-highest is AA+, etc. Investment-grade ratings go from AAA to BBB-. Moody's uses 1, 2, or 3 (Aa1 is better than Aa2, which is better than Aa3). Investment-grade ratings go from Aaa to Baa3.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Investment Grade = BBB/Baa or Better</div>
  <p>Most institutions restrict their investments to bonds of investment grade. Bonds below investment grade, commonly called <span class="key-term">junk bonds</span> or <span class="key-term">high-yield bonds</span>, are considered speculative or non-investment grade. BB+/Ba1 is the highest speculative rating, while the lowest is D/C.</p>
</div>

#### Short-Term Debt Ratings

Moody's also rates short-term corporate and municipal issues for credit risk. The ratings for short-term issues differ:

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Commercial Paper</th>
      <th>Municipal Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>P1</td>
      <td>MIG 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>P2</td>
      <td>MIG 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>P3</td>
      <td>MIG 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>NP (Not Prime)</td>
      <td>SG (Speculative Grade)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Topic 2: Interest Rate Risk and Price Volatility

<span class="key-term">Interest rate risk</span> is the risk that rising interest rates will cause bond prices to fall. Bonds with long-term maturities or low coupon rates, and those sold at a deep discount, are most susceptible.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Market Risk vs. Interest Rate Risk</div>
  <p>In the context of bonds, interest rate risk is sometimes called market risk. However, market risk has a broader meaning: the risk that overall economic conditions will affect all investments. It is typically because interest rates are rising, which is why the terms "interest rate risk" and "market risk" are used interchangeably when talking about bonds.</p>
</div>

#### Variable-Rate Bonds

<span class="key-term">Variable-rate bonds</span> (also called <span class="key-term">adjustable-rate</span> or <span class="key-term">floating-rate</span> bonds) have an interest rate that adjusts periodically to match market rates. This causes the coupon rate to move in the same direction as interest rates.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Variable-Rate Bond Behavior</div>
  <p>As market interest rates move up, the variable-rate bond's coupon adjusts up, so the bond trades close to par. The price stays close to par because the yield adjusts to match market rates.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Variable-rate bonds do not have significant interest rate risk.</p>
</div>

#### Step-Coupon Bonds

A <span class="key-term">step-coupon bond</span> is issued with a coupon rate that will increase over time based on a predetermined schedule. These increases may or may not reflect current market rates—they're subject to call risk.

#### Price Volatility

A bond's <span class="key-term">price volatility</span> is how much the bond's price is likely to move in response to interest rate changes. The major factors affecting volatility are:

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Factor</th>
      <th>More Volatile</th>
      <th>Less Volatile</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Time to maturity</strong></td>
      <td>Longer maturity</td>
      <td>Shorter maturity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Coupon rate</strong></td>
      <td>Lower coupon</td>
      <td>Higher coupon</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Duration

The term used to express a bond's overall sensitivity to interest rate swings is <span class="key-term">duration</span>.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Duration Rules</div>
  <ul>
    <li>A long-duration bond (long maturity and a low coupon) is a very price-volatile bond</li>
    <li>A short-duration bond (short maturity, high coupon) is a very price-stable bond</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Maturity + Coupon = Volatility</div>
  <p>Combining the factors of maturity and coupon rate, as market interest rates move up, the percentage of downward price movement of bonds (ranked from greatest to lowest):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Large discount bond (lowest coupon)</li>
    <li>Small discount bond</li>
    <li>Par bond</li>
    <li>Small premium bond</li>
    <li>Large premium bond (highest coupon)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The most volatile bonds are deep discount long-term maturity bonds. The most steeply discounted issues are zero-coupon bonds—they have no interest payments, so the entire value is the principal repayment at maturity. Long-term zero-coupon issues are the most volatile of all bond issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Price and rate volatility are often confused on the exam. Be sure to carefully read the question.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Adjustable-rate bonds are suitable for investors looking for protection from interest rate risk.</p>
</div>

### Topic 3: Other Bond Risks

<span class="key-term">Investment risk</span> is divided into two broad categories: <span class="key-term">systematic risk</span> (affects all investments) and <span class="key-term">nonsystematic risk</span> (unique to specific securities or issuers).

Systematic risks cannot be diversified away—they affect the entire market. Nonsystematic risks can be reduced through diversification.

#### Types of Risk

</div>

#### Key Risk Definitions

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Purchasing Power Risk (Inflation Risk)</div>
  <p>The risk that the investor will be able to buy fewer goods and services when the bond matures. The only bonds that offer protection against purchasing power risk are <span class="key-term">Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)</span>, which were issued by the U.S. government specifically for this purpose.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Reinvestment Risk</div>
  <p>The risk that when an investor receives returns on their investments, they will not be able to reinvest those returns at comparable rates. With bonds, a common form of reinvestment risk is that interest rates are falling. The early return of principal requires the investor to find somewhere to reinvest—if they want to keep generating returns. In an environment of falling interest rates, the investor may have to settle for lower returns.</p>
  <p><strong>Call risk and prepayment risk both increase reinvestment risk.</strong> This is because calls and prepayments are both more likely when interest rates fall.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Currency Risk</div>
  <p>Currency risk applies to foreign investments that trade in their home country's currency and pay returns in that currency. The risk is that the value of the foreign currency will deteriorate relative to the U.S. dollar. Note: if the value of a foreign currency weakens against the U.S. dollar, it is the same as the U.S. dollar strengthening against the foreign currency.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Legislative Risk</div>
  <p>The risk of investing in foreign countries that have weak political and legal systems. Typically, less developed countries carry more legislative/political risk.</p>
</div>

*Chapter 3 builds on Chapter 2's bond fundamentals by adding complexity: features that benefit issuers (calls) or investors (puts), and the full spectrum of risks that affect fixed-income investments. Master these concepts before moving to Chapter 4, which covers specific types of corporate and government debt.*
