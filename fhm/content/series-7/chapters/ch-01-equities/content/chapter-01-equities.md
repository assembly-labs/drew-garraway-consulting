## Section 1: Common Stock Basics

### Introduction

Companies can finance their operations in one of two ways: **equity financing** (issuing stock) or **debt financing** (issuing bonds). The term stock typically refers to common stock. Common stock is an ownership interest (equity) in an issuing corporation. Stock owners share in the benefits and rights of ownership, so we call it a share of stock. Types of common stocks range from relatively safe (defensive) issues to up-and-coming (but riskier) technology issues.

### Key Concepts
- Common Stock Terms

---

### Topic 1: Common Stock Terms

#### Common Stock Is Equity

A common stockholder (shareholder) is an owner of a piece of a corporation. Owners are considered to have equity in the company. In addition to corporations, investment companies, such as mutual funds, also issue common stock. Common stockholders hope to share in the growth of the company, which will be reflected in the share price.

#### Authorized Stock and Par Value

When a corporation is formed, its corporate charter authorizes that a fixed number of common shares may be issued. This is called **authorized stock**.

The stock is assigned an arbitrary **par value**. For example, common stock might be assigned a par value of $1 per share. Par value for common stock has no bearing on the market price of the stock but is simply used for accounting purposes. Market value is based on investor expectations about the future of the company.

#### Issued Stock

To raise capital needed to finance a corporation, the company will issue stock.

Assume that a corporation is authorized under its charter to sell 1,000,000 common shares. But the corporation chooses not to issue all its authorized shares right away. It sells only part of the authorized amount to the public so that it can sell more shares later (without having to amend its corporate charter).

If this corporation issues 400,000 shares, it still has 600,000 shares available that can be issued later:

| Issued Shares | Unissued Shares |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 400,000 | 600,000 |
| **1,000,000 Authorized Shares** ||

#### Outstanding Shares

Once issued, the shares are said to be outstanding. The corporation now has 400,000 shares outstanding (also termed outstanding shares) that can be traded between investors.

The number of shares outstanding times the current market price is used to find the company's **market capitalization** (market cap). So, if this company has 400,000 shares outstanding, and has shares with a market price of $10 per share, the company's market cap would be $4 million.

#### Treasury Stock

After issuance, the corporation may choose to **buy back** some of these previously issued shares. Repurchased shares are called **treasury stock** or **treasury shares**.

Assume that the corporation has repurchased 100,000 common shares. The common stock structure is now:

| 400,000 Issued Shares | 600,000 Unissued Shares |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| 300,000 Outstanding | |
| 100,000 Treasury | |
| **1,000,000 Authorized Shares** ||

The company may choose to resell treasury stock in the future or use the stock to finance an acquisition of another company. They may also use the stock for an employee stock purchase plan.

The number of shares that remain outstanding is commonly used to determine a company's value. Purchasing shares in the secondary market will boost the earnings per share of the company, because as outstanding shares are taken out of circulation, earnings will be divided among fewer shares. An increase in earnings per share will usually boost the share price. Companies may also repurchase stock as treasury stock (a stock buyback) if they have excess cash and believe their outstanding shares are trading in the market for less than they are actually worth.

**Key Differences:**
- Common shares have the right to vote on issues that will affect them. Treasury shares do not have the right to vote.
- Common shares have the right to receive dividends. Treasury shares do not.

#### Transfer Agents and Registrars

Corporations will hire transfer agents and registrars (often within the same company) to maintain ownership records:
- **Transfer agent**: Records changes of ownership, cancels and issues certificates, and maintains a list of shareholders
- **Registrar**: Audits and oversees the transfer agent and verifies shareholder information
- **Paying agent**: (Also typically in the same company) handles distributions such as dividends

#### Regular Way Settlement

Equity securities can be traded on an exchange (**listed**) or **over-the-counter (unlisted)**. Listed securities must meet stringent listing standards. Over-the-counter (OTC) securities are typically smaller companies that do not meet the requirements to be listed on an exchange such as the **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** or the **National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations**, now simply known as **Nasdaq**.

**Settlement**: When an investor buys a security, they immediately become the economic owner. This means that once the trade has been executed, the new owner will immediately take on the risk of the price rising or falling in the future. Although the buyer is now the economic owner of the security, they will not be recorded as the new owner until the trade **settles**. Settlement occurs when the securities and the purchase price have officially changed hands. At that time, the buyer becomes the **owner of record**.

**Regular Way Settlement**: When a trade is executed in an equity or equity-related security, settlement occurs 1 business day after the trade date. This is called **T+1 settlement**, also known as **regular way settlement**.

## Section 2: Distributions

### Introduction

Shareholders invest in a company to gain from future profits and future growth. Much of an investor's return will come from an increase in the market value of the stock. In addition, corporations may make distributions called dividends directly to shareholders that will also increase an investor's returns.

### Key Concepts
- Dividends and Stock Splits
- Preemptive Rights

---

### Topic 1: Dividends and Stock Splits

#### Dividends

**Cash dividends** enable a company to share a part of the corporation's profits with shareholders. Dividends are declared by the **board of directors** and are typically paid quarterly to shareholders of record. Some companies, such as utilities, pay higher than average dividends, while many high-tech companies pay no dividends at all.

Not all companies pay dividends. Many smaller, younger companies decide to reinvest their **profits** (also called **earnings**) back into the company rather than distribute them to shareholders.

#### Stock Dividends

**Stock dividends** involve giving additional shares to existing stockholders. When a company decides to issue stock dividends, the total number of shares outstanding increases, but the value of each outstanding share decreases. This is because although there are now more shares outstanding, the value of the company has not changed. As a result, there is no immediate economic value to the shareholders who receive a stock dividend. But they will benefit if the value of these shares increases in the future.

Stock dividends are defined as any stock distribution that involves less than 25% of the outstanding shares. A larger distribution of shares would be considered a **stock split**.

#### Stock Splits

Stock splits increase (a **forward stock split**) or decrease (a **reverse stock split**) the number of shares outstanding. Stock splits are made using a ratio, such as 2:1 (2 for 1). In a 2:1 forward split, a shareholder would wind up with twice the number of shares as they previously owned. For example, a shareholder with 100 shares would now have 200 shares.

But, as with stock dividends, there is no immediate economic value for existing shareholders, as the price per share will be proportionately reduced. For this reason, a stock split is not currently taxable but results in an adjustment of the position's cost basis.

> **Example**: Imagine that the stock was selling for $50 before the 2:1 forward stock split. The value of the investor's stock is 100 × $50 = $5,000. Immediately after the split, each share would now be priced at $25. The value of the investor's stock is still $5,000 because 200 shares × $25 = $5,000. The value of each shareholder's stock stays the same after a stock split.

So why would a company choose to split its stock? In the earlier example, although there would now be twice as many shares outstanding, the price per share would be reduced by 50%. This would make the price per share more affordable for small shareholders.

A **reverse stock split**, such as a 1:10 (1 for 10), would result in fewer shares outstanding but at a higher price per share. A reverse stock split might be made for a company whose share price has fallen below a minimum price required by an exchange such as the NYSE.

Also note that when a company executes a stock split, the par value of each share will be adjusted accordingly, while the total par value of its outstanding shares will remain the same. For example, ABC Company has 1 million shares, and each share has a par value of $1.00. Following a 2:1 forward stock split, ABC will have 2 million shares, each with a par value of $0.50.

Neither stock splits nor stock dividends dilute proportional ownership as additional shares are received by all common shareholders. Corporations can issue convertible securities that can be converted into common stock. This would cause a dilution of the existing common shareholders' ownership stake.

#### Uneven Stock Splits

Some splits will be a bit more complicated.

> **Example**: XYZ declares a 5:4 forward stock split. The price of XYZ prior to the split was $30 per share. A customer owns 300 shares of XYZ. What will their position look like after the split?
> - Step 1: Take the number of shares: 300/1 × 5/4 = 1500/4 = 375 shares
> - Step 2: Take the price: $30/1 × 4/5 (the inverse of the split) = $120/5 = $24
> - To check the math, the customer's position should be the same before and after the split.
> - Value before split = 300 shares × $30 = $9,000
> - Value after split = 375 shares × $24 = $9,000

While cash dividends are typically paid quarterly, stock dividends and stock splits are distributed on an irregular basis. And while cash dividends are taxable upon receipt, stock dividends and stock splits are not.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: As part of a stock split (forward or reverse), the par value of the stock must be adjusted proportionately. So, a stock with a par value of $1 per share would have a new par value of $0.50 per share after a 2:1 stock split.

---

### Topic 2: Preemptive Rights

Shareholders may have the right to keep their proportional ownership in the company if the company chooses to issue more shares. This is called a **preemptive right**, and it protects shareholders from their ownership interest being diluted. Companies will often fulfill this right by issuing separate securities called rights.

**Rights**, also called **preemptive rights** or **subscription rights**, are distributed to shareholders prior to the issuance of new shares to the public. This may be referred to as a **rights offering**. Rights are short-term securities that give the owner the option to buy a certain number of shares at a reduced price over a short period of time. The exercise terms will include how many rights are needed to purchase one share of stock (e.g., 10 for 1, 5 for 1, 1 for 1). Typically, rights will expire within 30 to 60 days.

A right gives the shareholder the option to do one of three things:
1. Exercise their right and buy new shares at a price below the current market price
2. Sell the right to another investor
3. Do nothing and let the right expire worthless

If the shareholder chooses to exercise their rights, they will wind up keeping their proportional ownership of the company. But they are under no obligation to do so. If the client chooses not to exercise, their interest is diluted.

---

### Summary: Distributions

- **Dividends and stock splits**: Cash dividends, stock dividends, forward and reverse splits
- **Preemptive rights**: Ability to keep proportional ownership; features including discount price, ability to sell, expiration

## Section 3: Rights of Common Shareholders

### Introduction

Shareholders of common stock are owners of the corporation and take on certain risks (e.g., they could lose money), but they also receive certain benefits. One benefit is that common shareholders enjoy **limited liability**. This means that their losses are limited to the money they invest. They also have several legal rights.

### Key Concepts
- Basic Rights of Common Shareholders
- Voting Rights and Methods

---

### Topic 1: Basic Rights of Common Shareholders

As owners of a corporation, shareholders have certain rights. These rights may include:

- **Right to inspect books and records**: Corporations must provide shareholders with audited annual reports that include the company's financial statements
- **Right to transfer ownership**: Shares are liquid, meaning that they are negotiable and can be bought and sold
- **Preemptive right**: The right to proportional ownership of the company if new shares are issued. This right may be spelled out in an **anti-dilution provision**
- **Right to corporate distributions**: Shareholders have the right to receive distributions such as dividends, if declared by the board of directors. In other words, when the board declares dividends for a class of common shares, it must pay the same dividend for each share in that class
- **Right to corporate assets upon dissolution**: In the event of a liquidation, shareholders have a **residual interest** in the company's assets. This means that they will be paid after all other claims have been satisfied
- **Right to vote**: Shareholders have the right to approve certain corporate decisions

---

### Topic 2: Voting Rights and Methods

#### Voting Rights

Common stockholders vote at the company's annual meeting. They vote for the **board of directors**, which will oversee the management of the issuer on behalf of the shareholders. Shareholders also have the right to vote on matters that affect their ownership interest. For example, common shareholders must approve any changes to the basic goals of the corporation. Other specific decisions also require shareholder approval.

**Items That Require a Shareholder Vote:**
Generally, shareholder approval is needed if the corporation wishes to take the following actions:
- Declare a stock split
- Declare a reverse stock split
- Issue convertible bonds or preferred stock
- Issue stock options to officers on a preferential basis
- Engage in most mergers and acquisitions

**Items That Do Not Require a Shareholder Vote:**
Generally, shareholder approval is **not** required if the corporation wishes to take the following actions:
- Declare a cash dividend
- Declare a stock dividend
- Declare a preemptive rights distribution

In all these situations, shareholders are benefiting by receiving cash, shares, or rights. In the case of treasury stock, a share buyback reduces the number of common shares outstanding, so the **earnings per share** of the company increase; which, in turn, typically increases the market price of the stock. Companies that have excess funds will often buy back stock for their treasury since it benefits the existing common stockholders.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: Treasury stock does not vote and does not receive dividends.

#### Voting Methods

Each shareholder gets one vote per share per voting item (e.g., a seat on the board of directors). Corporations will use one of two voting methods: statutory voting or cumulative voting. Statutory voting is more common than cumulative voting.

**Statutory Voting**: Most corporations use statutory voting. Under statutory voting, votes must be evenly cast.

> **Example**: Assume that three seats are open on the board of directors (three voting items). Voting rights for a shareholder with 100 shares would work as follows: The shareholder would have 300 votes (100 shares × 3 openings). The shareholder could cast exactly 100 votes for any one candidate. If they only wanted to vote for one candidate, they could only cast 100 votes.

**Cumulative Voting**: Under cumulative voting, the shareholder may divide their total votes in whatever manner they choose.

> **Example**: Assume that three seats are open on the board of directors (three voting items). Voting rights for a shareholder with 100 shares would work as follows: The shareholder would again have 300 votes, but they might choose to cast all 300 for one candidate. Or they might cast 200 for one candidate and 100 for another.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: Cumulative voting is an advantage for the "small investor" since they can vote disproportionately to exert more influence in the election of individual directors.

#### Proxy Voting

The actual vote will take place at the annual shareholders' meeting. Shareholders not attending the meeting must receive ballots from the company. These ballots are called **proxies** because a proxy (stand-in) is granted the **power of attorney** to cast votes on behalf of the shareholders who choose not to attend.

#### Nonvoting Stock

Corporations may issue a class of common stock that has no voting rights. These securities are identical to ordinary shares in terms of dividends, residual claims, and other rights, but their owners cannot vote to elect directors or approve company policies. Nonvoting stock allows a company to raise additional capital while maintaining the existing voting power of its current owners.

---

### Summary: Rights of Common Shareholders

- **Basic rights of common shareholders**: Right to inspect books and records, right to transfer ownership, preemptive rights, right to corporate distributions and residual assets upon dissolution, right to vote
- **Voting rights and methods**: Actions that require voter approval; statutory, cumulative, and proxy voting

## Section 4: Preferred Stock

### Introduction

In addition to common stock, companies may issue another type of equity security called preferred stock. The name comes from the fact that preferred stock gets preferred treatment over common stock in both dividends and in liquidation. Preferred stock trades in the secondary market. Although preferred stock represents an equity stake in the company, it has many features that are similar to bonds.

### Key Concepts
- Preferred Stock Basic Features
- Types of Preferred Stock
- Interest Rate Movements and Preferred Stock Prices

---

### Topic 1: Preferred Stock Basic Features

#### Senior Equity Security

Preferred stock is a senior equity security because it has priority over the common stock issued by the company. If the company declares a common stock dividend, preferred shareholders must receive their dividends for the entire year before the common stock dividend can be paid. If the company liquidates, preferred shareholders are paid before common shareholders.

#### $100 Par, Fixed Dividend Rate, Semiannual, or Quarterly Payments

Preferred stock is typically issued at $100 par with a stated dividend rate—for example, a company issues $100 par 10% preferred stock. The annual dividend is 10% of $100 par = $10 per year. Preferred dividends may be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or on an irregular basis. Preferred dividends were traditionally paid semiannually, but in most cases, are now paid quarterly. Changes in market value will not impact the annual dividend rate.

#### No Voting or Preemptive Rights

Unlike common stock, preferred stock does not have the right to vote and does not have preemptive rights.

#### Preferred Stock Has Similar Features to Bonds

Although preferred stock is an equity security, its features are similar to bonds. Bondholders also receive a fixed interest rate, are paid semiannually, and do not have voting or preemptive rights. The differences are listed below:

- Bonds mature on a set date while preferred stock has an indefinite life
- Bondholders have priority of claim to interest payments and corporate assets upon liquidation ahead of preferred shareholders
- Bondholders have a legal right to interest payments; preferred dividends are only paid if declared by the board of directors

| | Common Stock | Preferred Stock |
|---|---|---|
| **Market price** | Market price fluctuates with issuer's profits and losses | Market price fluctuates with interest rates and issuer's creditworthiness |
| **Risk** | Riskier, but more growth potential | Less risky, but less growth potential |
| **Voting rights** | One per share | None |
| **Income production (dividends) and appreciation** | May receive a share in company's profits in the form of dividends. Dividends may or may not be paid regularly. Participate in the company's growth through appreciation in stock price | When dividends are paid, they are paid as a fixed percentage of par (e.g., 5% of par). Seniority over common stock, meaning dividend payments are paid to preferred stockholders before they are paid to common stockholders |

---

### Topic 2: Types of Preferred Stock

Preferred stock can be issued in different forms. Many of these types of preferred stock will also be seen with bonds. The types of preferred stock include:
- Cumulative
- Adjustable and variable rate
- Callable
- Convertible
- Participating

#### Cumulative Preferred

If the issuer does not pay, the missed payments accumulate and must be paid before the issuer can resume making any other dividend payments. All accumulated preferred dividends must be paid, including the entire current year's dividends, before a dividend can be paid to common shareholders.

#### Adjustable and Variable Rate Preferred

**Adjustable-rate preferred stock** (also referred to as variable or floating rate preferred) pays a dividend that is based on a benchmark rate (e.g., Treasury bill rate). The risk is that the amount of the dividend may rise or fall with market interest rates—a benefit when rates are rising, but this will reduce an investor's income when rates are falling. However, since adjustable-rate securities follow market rates, the price of these securities will remain relatively stable, providing **preservation of capital**.

#### Callable Preferred

If preferred stock is callable, the issuer has the right to redeem the shares after a set date. When called, the shareholder will typically receive the par amount. Issuers may call in shares when interest rates fall. After retiring the old higher-rate shares, new preferred shares can be issued at the current lower rates. Callable preferred shares typically pay dividends higher than noncallable issues. Bonds may also be callable.

With both callable preferred and callable bonds, the issuer may set up a **sinking fund**. This money is set aside to retire callable securities, typically when interest rates are falling.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: Common stock is not callable.

#### Convertible Preferred

If preferred stock is convertible, shareholders can exchange their preferred shares for common stock based on a predetermined price. If they choose to convert, existing common shareholders' interests will be diluted. If the market price of the common stock rises, the convertible's value is pushed up as well. The issuer can sell convertibles with lower dividend rates because of the value of the conversion feature. These issues may be callable or subject to a forced conversion if the market price of the stock stays above a predetermined level for a specified period.

> **Test-Taking Tip**: The price of convertible preferred is typically driven by the price of the issuer's common shares.

#### Participating Preferred

In addition to the fixed dividend rate, participating preferred shareholders may also be given additional dividends. These extra dividends must be declared by the board of directors. This feature enables shareholders to participate in the earnings of the company more fully. If the company has strong earnings, a special dividend may be declared. Participating preferred shareholders would receive this dividend.

---

### Topic 3: Interest Rate Movements and Preferred Stock Prices

#### Preferred Stock Has a Fixed Dividend Rate

When preferred stock is issued, the dividend rate is set at a level comparable to the current market rate of interest for equivalent securities. Once the preferred stock is issued, its market price will primarily depend on current interest rates. But regardless of the market price of the preferred stock, the dividend paid will still be a percentage of the par amount (typically $100).

#### Current Yield

We can calculate the current yield of preferred stock as we do with common stock: by dividing the fixed annual income by the current market price.

> **Current Yield = Annual Income from Security / Market Price of Security**

> **Example**: If a preferred stock has a fixed rate dividend of 10% and a current market price of $90 per share, what is the current yield?
> - Current Yield = $10 annual dividends ÷ $90 market price
> - The current yield would be 11.1% ($10/$90). That is the current rate of return that an investor would earn if they bought 10% preferred stock at a price of $90 per share. Note that the current yield of 11.1% is higher than the dividend rate. That is because the investor purchased the preferred stock at a discount, which increased their overall yield on the investment.

There is an **inverse relationship** between interest rate movements and preferred stock prices. As rates rise, prices of existing preferred shares will fall. Conversely, if rates fall, the price of preferred stock will rise. This relationship will also be seen with bond prices.

### Summary: Preferred Stock

- **Preferred stock basic features**: Senior status, par value, stated dividends; key differences from and similarities to bonds
- **Types of preferred stock**: Cumulative, adjustable and variable rate, callable, convertible, participating
- **Interest rate movements and preferred stock prices**: Impact on the value of preferred stock, concept of current yield

## Section 5: Special Securities

### Introduction

In addition to common stock, preferred stock, and rights, there are other equity and equity-like securities. Two examples are **warrants** and **American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)**.

### Key Concepts
- Warrants
- American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)

---

### Topic 1: Warrants

#### Warrants are Attached to New Stock or Bond Issues

A warrant is a security that allows the holder to buy a particular stock at a fixed price. This price is usually quite a bit above the market price of the stock when the warrant is issued. Warrants only become valuable if the stock price rises.

Warrants are sometimes referred to as "sweeteners" because they sweeten the deal, making the new issue more attractive to investors. Although received as part of a packaged unit, a warrant is a separate security that can be traded by itself.

> **Example**: A new issue is being sold as a unit consisting of one common share and one warrant. The warrant gives the owner the right to buy an additional common share in the future. The common stock is currently valued at $20 per share, and the warrant allows the purchase of the additional share at $30. The warrant expires in 5 years.

A warrant usually includes a period before it can be exercised (e.g., 1 year). After the waiting period, it can be exercised at the set price until expiration. Many warrants have a lifetime at issuance of five to ten years, but some are perpetual, which means they don't expire.

#### Comparing Warrants and Rights

Warrants and rights are both securities that can be traded, exercised to buy the underlying security, or allowed to expire worthless. However, they differ in their initial exercise price and time to expiration.

| | Exercise Price | Expiration | Can Be Traded |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rights** | Below the market price | Short-term | Yes |
| **Warrants** | Above the market price | Long-term | Yes |

Warrants are issued with no intrinsic value since the exercise price is above the market price of the stock. As long-term securities, they do have considerable time value. Rights are issued with intrinsic value since the exercise price is below the market price of the stock. They have very little time value because they are short-term securities.

Warrants, rights, and convertible securities are not considered equity unless they are exercised and converted into common stock.

#### Perpetual Warrants

Warrants usually have a life of five years, but sometimes perpetual warrants are issued. These warrants have no expiration.

---

### Topic 2: American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)

#### ADRs Are a Vehicle for Trading Foreign Securities in the U.S.

The purpose of an ADR is to facilitate the trading of foreign securities in the United States. Foreign companies can list their shares for trading on stock exchanges in the U.S. However, this process can be time consuming and costly. An alternative is to offer a receipt that represents shares of a foreign company.

#### How ADRs Are Created

A bank will buy foreign stock and place it in trust in the country of origin. The bank then issues American Depositary Receipts, which are backed by the securities held in trust. The ADRs are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sold in the U.S., and priced in U.S. dollars.

#### ADR Receipt Holder Rights

As dividend payments are received, the bank passes these on to the receipt holder in U.S. dollars. But the receipt holder does not have voting or preemptive rights. The bank votes the shares that it owns, and it will sell off any preemptive rights and send the money to the receipt holder.

#### Exchange Rate Risk (Currency Risk)

Although ADRs are priced in U.S. dollars, the market price will depend in part on changes in foreign currency markets. The risk of currency exchange fluctuation is called **exchange rate risk** or **currency risk**. ADRs are subject to currency risk. If the foreign currency weakens against the U.S. dollar, the ADR will be worth less in U.S. dollars.
