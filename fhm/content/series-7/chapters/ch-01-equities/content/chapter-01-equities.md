## Section 1: Common Stock Basics

On May 17, 1792, twenty-four stockbrokers gathered under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street and signed an agreement to trade securities only among themselves and charge minimum commissions. That moment—the Buttonwood Agreement—created what would become the New York Stock Exchange. Those early traders dealt in exactly two things: government bonds and the few bank stocks that existed at the time.

Today, the global equity market holds over $100 trillion in value. Understanding how stocks work isn't just academic—it's the foundation of everything else on your Series 7 exam.

### Why This Section Matters

Companies need money to operate. They can borrow it (debt financing) or sell ownership stakes (equity financing). When you buy stock, you're buying a piece of a company—literally. This chapter covers the mechanics of how that ownership works: what shares are, how they're tracked, and what happens when they change hands.

---

### Topic 1: Common Stock Terms

#### Common Stock Is Equity

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The word "stock" comes from the old English word for a tree trunk—the solid base from which everything else grows. A "share" of stock meant you shared in that growth. The terminology has survived for centuries because the concept is simple: you own a piece of something.</p>
</div>

A <span class="key-term">common stockholder</span> (or shareholder) owns a piece of a corporation. This ownership represents <span class="key-term">equity</span> in the company. Beyond corporations, investment companies like mutual funds also issue common stock. Common stockholders hope to share in the company's growth through increases in the share price.

#### Authorized Stock and Par Value

When a corporation is formed, its <span class="key-term">corporate charter</span> specifies the maximum number of common shares the company may issue. This ceiling is called <span class="key-term">authorized stock</span>.

Each share is assigned an arbitrary <span class="key-term">par value</span>—perhaps $1 or even $0.01 per share. Here's what trips up many test-takers: par value for common stock has absolutely no bearing on market price. It's purely an accounting artifact. Market value is based on investor expectations about the company's future.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Don't confuse par value for common stock with par value for bonds or preferred stock. For common stock, par is meaningless for pricing. For bonds and preferred, par matters enormously.</p>
</div>

#### Issued Stock

To raise capital, a corporation will <span class="key-term">issue</span> (sell) stock to the public.

Here's the strategic reality: most companies don't issue all their authorized shares at once. They hold some back. Why? Because issuing more shares later—without amending the corporate charter—is much easier than going back to shareholders for permission to increase authorized shares.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <p>A corporation is authorized to sell 1,000,000 common shares. It issues only 400,000 shares initially, keeping 600,000 in reserve:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Issued Shares</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Unissued Shares</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>400,000</td>
      <td>600,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2"><strong>Total Authorized: 1,000,000 Shares</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Outstanding Shares

Once issued, shares are said to be <span class="key-term">outstanding</span>. These outstanding shares can be freely traded between investors.

The number of outstanding shares times the current market price gives you the company's <span class="key-term">market capitalization</span> (market cap).

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Market Cap = Outstanding Shares × Market Price per Share</div>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <p>If a company has 400,000 shares outstanding at $10 per share, its market cap is $4 million. This is how investors quickly compare company sizes: Apple's market cap exceeds $3 trillion, while a small-cap company might have a market cap under $2 billion.</p>
</div>

#### Treasury Stock

After issuing stock, a corporation may choose to <span class="key-term">buy back</span> some shares. Repurchased shares are called <span class="key-term">treasury stock</span> (or treasury shares).

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Companies Buy Back Stock</div>
  <p>Stock buybacks became popular in the 1980s when the SEC provided a safe harbor from manipulation charges. Today, companies buy back stock for several strategic reasons: to boost earnings per share (fewer shares means earnings are divided among fewer pieces), to signal that management believes shares are undervalued, to fund employee stock purchase plans, or simply because they have excess cash and no better investment ideas.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <p>The corporation from our earlier example repurchases 100,000 shares. The structure becomes:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">400,000 Issued Shares</th>
      <th>600,000 Unissued</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>300,000 Outstanding</td>
      <td>100,000 Treasury</td>
      <td>—</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3"><strong>Total Authorized: 1,000,000 Shares</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Memorize This: Treasury Stock Limitations</div>
  <p>Treasury shares are different from outstanding shares in two critical ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Treasury shares cannot vote</strong> — Only outstanding shares vote</li>
    <li><strong>Treasury shares do not receive dividends</strong> — Dividends go only to outstanding shares</li>
  </ul>
</div>

(Whether those buyback decisions consistently add value for shareholders is a debate that has launched a thousand academic papers and at least one congressional hearing.)

#### Transfer Agents and Registrars

Corporations hire specialized firms to maintain ownership records:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Transfer Agent** | Records ownership changes, cancels and issues certificates, maintains shareholder list |
| **Registrar** | Audits the transfer agent, verifies shareholder information |
| **Paying Agent** | Handles distributions like dividends (often the same firm) |

#### Regular Way Settlement

Equity securities trade on exchanges (<span class="key-term">listed</span>) or <span class="key-term">over-the-counter</span> (unlisted). Listed securities meet stringent requirements set by exchanges like the <span class="key-term">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</span> or <span class="key-term">Nasdaq</span>. OTC securities are typically smaller companies that don't meet listing standards.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Settlement Matters</div>
  <p>When you buy a stock, you immediately become the economic owner—if the price drops five minutes later, that's your loss. But you're not the official owner of record until the trade settles. The distinction matters because dividends, votes, and other rights go to the owner of record, not necessarily the economic owner.</p>
</div>

<span class="key-term">Settlement</span> occurs when securities and money officially change hands. At that point, the buyer becomes the <span class="key-term">owner of record</span>.

For equities, <span class="key-term">regular way settlement</span> is <span class="key-term">T+1</span>—one business day after the trade date. This is the standard for equities and equity-related securities.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> T+1 settlement was implemented in May 2024, replacing the older T+2 standard. If you see older study materials referencing T+2, ignore them—the exam tests current rules.</p>

## Section 2: Distributions

In 1626, the Dutch West India Company paid the first dividend in what would become America—a return to shareholders from the profits of the fur trade. Nearly four centuries later, dividends remain one of the fundamental ways corporations share profits with their owners. But there's more than one way to give shareholders value.

### Why This Section Matters

Investors buy stock for two reasons: growth (the price goes up) and income (they receive cash along the way). Understanding how corporations distribute value to shareholders—through cash dividends, stock dividends, stock splits, and rights offerings—is essential for advising clients and passing your exam.

---

### Topic 1: Dividends and Stock Splits

#### Cash Dividends

<span class="key-term">Cash dividends</span> allow a company to share profits with shareholders. The <span class="key-term">board of directors</span> declares dividends, typically paid quarterly to shareholders of record.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Some Companies Don't Pay Dividends</div>
  <p>Young, growing companies often reinvest all their profits (also called earnings) back into the business rather than paying dividends. The logic: if the company can earn 20% returns by expanding, why give that money to shareholders who might only earn 5% in a savings account? This is why many tech companies pay no dividends—they believe they can grow shareholders' wealth faster by keeping the cash. Mature companies like utilities typically pay higher dividends because their growth opportunities are limited.</p>
</div>

#### Stock Dividends

<span class="key-term">Stock dividends</span> give additional shares to existing stockholders instead of cash. When a company issues stock dividends, the total number of shares outstanding increases, but the value of each share decreases proportionally.

Here's the key insight: there's no immediate economic value to shareholders who receive a stock dividend. The company's total value hasn't changed—it's just been sliced into more pieces. But shareholders will benefit if those shares appreciate in the future.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Stock dividends are defined as distributions of less than 25% of outstanding shares. Anything 25% or larger is classified as a stock split, not a dividend.</p>
</div>

#### Stock Splits

<span class="key-term">Stock splits</span> increase (<span class="key-term">forward split</span>) or decrease (<span class="key-term">reverse split</span>) the number of shares outstanding using a ratio.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Forward Split Example (2:1)</div>
  <p>An investor owns 100 shares at $50 each = $5,000 total value.</p>
  <p>After a 2:1 split: 200 shares at $25 each = $5,000 total value.</p>
  <p>Same pizza, twice as many slices.</p>
</div>

**Why would a company split its stock?** A lower share price makes shares more accessible to small investors. When a stock trades at $1,000 per share, many retail investors simply can't afford it (or think they can't, even with fractional shares available). A 10:1 split brings the price to $100—psychologically more accessible.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Reverse Split Example (1:10)</div>
  <p>An investor owns 1,000 shares at $0.50 each = $500 total value.</p>
  <p>After a 1:10 reverse split: 100 shares at $5.00 each = $500 total value.</p>
  <p>Companies do this to meet minimum exchange price requirements or to appear more "respectable" to institutional investors who avoid penny stocks.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Par Value Adjusts with Splits</div>
  <p>When a company executes a stock split, the par value per share adjusts proportionally, but total par value stays the same.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> ABC has 1 million shares at $1.00 par = $1 million total par value. After a 2:1 split: 2 million shares at $0.50 par = $1 million total par value.</p>
</div>

#### Uneven Stock Splits

Some splits use ratios other than simple multiples.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Uneven Split Example (5:4)</div>
  <p><strong>Before:</strong> 300 shares at $30 = $9,000</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1 (Shares):</strong> 300 × (5/4) = 375 shares</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2 (Price):</strong> $30 × (4/5) = $24 per share</p>
  <p><strong>After:</strong> 375 shares at $24 = $9,000</p>
  <p>Note: For price, use the inverse of the split ratio.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Neither stock dividends nor stock splits are taxable when received. They result in a cost basis adjustment, not a taxable event. Cash dividends, however, are taxable upon receipt.</p>
</div>

---

### Topic 2: Preemptive Rights

<span class="key-term">Preemptive rights</span> protect shareholders from having their ownership diluted when a company issues new shares. Without this protection, a company could issue millions of new shares, and your 5% stake could become 0.5% overnight.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Preemptive Rights Exist</div>
  <p>Imagine owning 10% of a company. The board, controlled by other shareholders, decides to issue shares only to their friends at a bargain price. Suddenly your 10% becomes 1%. Preemptive rights—sometimes spelled out in anti-dilution provisions—ensure existing shareholders get first crack at new shares to maintain their proportional ownership.</p>
</div>

Companies fulfill preemptive rights by issuing securities called <span class="key-term">rights</span> (also called <span class="key-term">subscription rights</span>). This is called a <span class="key-term">rights offering</span>.

Rights are short-term securities (typically 30-60 days until expiration) that give shareholders the option to buy new shares at a discount to market price. The terms specify how many rights are needed per share (e.g., 10 rights buy 1 new share).

**A shareholder receiving rights has three choices:**
1. **Exercise** — Buy new shares at the discounted price
2. **Sell** — Transfer the rights to another investor
3. **Do nothing** — Let the rights expire worthless

If the shareholder exercises, they maintain proportional ownership. If they don't, their interest is diluted.

## Section 3: Rights of Common Shareholders

In 1602, the Dutch East India Company became the first corporation to issue stock to the general public. The concept was revolutionary: ordinary people could own a piece of a massive trading enterprise. But ownership without rights is meaningless. What exactly do shareholders get for their money?

### Why This Section Matters

Common shareholders take on risk—they could lose their entire investment. In exchange, they receive specific legal rights. Understanding these rights is essential for advising clients and explaining why common stock differs from bonds or preferred stock.

---

### Topic 1: Basic Rights of Common Shareholders

As owners of a corporation, shareholders have certain legal rights:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Shareholder Rights</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Right</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Inspect books and records</strong></td>
      <td>Corporations must provide audited annual reports with financial statements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Transfer ownership</strong></td>
      <td>Shares are liquid—they can be bought and sold freely</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Preemptive rights</strong></td>
      <td>Maintain proportional ownership when new shares are issued</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Receive distributions</strong></td>
      <td>When dividends are declared, all shares in a class receive the same dividend</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Residual claim on assets</strong></td>
      <td>In liquidation, shareholders receive what's left after all debts are paid</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Vote</strong></td>
      <td>Approve certain corporate decisions</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

One crucial protection: shareholders enjoy <span class="key-term">limited liability</span>. This means their losses are capped at their investment. If a company goes bankrupt owing billions, shareholders lose only what they invested—creditors can't come after shareholders' personal assets.

---

### Topic 2: Voting Rights and Methods

#### What Shareholders Vote On

Common stockholders vote at the annual meeting, primarily to elect the <span class="key-term">board of directors</span>—the group that oversees management on shareholders' behalf.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Requires Shareholder Vote</th>
      <th>Does NOT Require Vote</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stock splits (forward or reverse)</td>
      <td>Cash dividends</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Issuing convertible bonds or preferred stock</td>
      <td>Stock dividends</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stock options to officers</td>
      <td>Preemptive rights distributions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Most mergers and acquisitions</td>
      <td>Treasury stock repurchases</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">The Logic Behind Voting Requirements</div>
  <p>Notice the pattern: shareholders must approve actions that could dilute their ownership (splits, convertibles, new stock options) or fundamentally change the company (mergers). They don't need to approve things that benefit them directly (dividends, rights). Treasury stock buybacks don't require approval because they actually benefit remaining shareholders by reducing shares outstanding.</p>
</div>

#### Voting Methods

Each shareholder gets one vote per share per voting item. Corporations use one of two methods:

**Statutory Voting** (most common): Votes must be evenly distributed across candidates.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Statutory Voting Example</div>
  <p>Three board seats are open. A shareholder with 100 shares has 300 total votes (100 × 3). Under statutory voting, they can cast exactly 100 votes for each candidate—no more, no less. If they only want to vote for one candidate, they can still only give that candidate 100 votes.</p>
</div>

**Cumulative Voting**: Shareholders can allocate votes however they choose.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Cumulative Voting Example</div>
  <p>Same scenario: 100 shares, three seats, 300 total votes. Under cumulative voting, the shareholder could cast all 300 votes for one candidate, or split them 200/100, or any combination totaling 300.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Cumulative voting benefits small investors because they can concentrate their votes to help elect at least one director who represents their interests. Think of it as giving the little guy a fighting chance.</p>
</div>

#### Proxy Voting

Most shareholders don't attend annual meetings in person. Companies send <span class="key-term">proxies</span>—ballots that grant <span class="key-term">power of attorney</span> to a stand-in who casts votes on the shareholder's behalf.

#### Nonvoting Stock

Some companies issue a class of common stock with no voting rights. These shares receive dividends and have the same residual claims as regular common stock—they just can't vote. This structure lets companies raise capital while founders or controlling shareholders maintain voting control.

(Silicon Valley loves this arrangement, which explains why many tech founders control their companies long after their economic ownership has been diluted to single digits.)

## Section 4: Preferred Stock

In 1836, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad issued the first American preferred stock to finance westward expansion. The railroad needed capital but didn't want to dilute the voting power of existing owners. The solution: create a new class of stock that offered better dividend treatment but no vote. Nearly two centuries later, preferred stock still occupies this hybrid space between common stock and bonds.

### Why This Section Matters

Preferred stock behaves like a bond in many ways—fixed payments, interest rate sensitivity, no voting rights—but it's technically equity. Understanding this hybrid nature is crucial because the Series 7 tests preferred stock concepts extensively.

---

### Topic 1: Preferred Stock Basic Features

#### Senior Equity Security

<span class="key-term">Preferred stock</span> is called "preferred" because it gets preferred treatment over common stock in two key situations:
1. **Dividends**: Preferred shareholders must receive their full year's dividends before common shareholders get anything
2. **Liquidation**: If the company dissolves, preferred shareholders are paid before common shareholders

#### Standard Terms: $100 Par, Fixed Dividend

Preferred stock is typically issued at <span class="key-term">$100 par</span> with a stated <span class="key-term">dividend rate</span>.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Preferred Dividend Calculation</div>
  <p>A company issues $100 par 10% preferred stock.</p>
  <p>Annual dividend = 10% × $100 = $10 per share per year</p>
  <p>Dividends are typically paid quarterly (so $2.50 per quarter), though some pay semiannually.</p>
  <p>Unlike common stock dividends, this rate is fixed regardless of how the market price fluctuates.</p>
</div>

#### No Voting or Preemptive Rights

Unlike common stock, preferred stockholders cannot vote and have no preemptive rights. This is the trade-off for their preferential dividend and liquidation treatment.

### Topic 2: Types of Preferred Stock

#### Cumulative Preferred

If the issuer skips dividend payments on <span class="key-term">cumulative preferred</span>, the missed payments accumulate. All accumulated dividends—plus the entire current year's dividends—must be paid before common shareholders can receive any dividend.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Cumulative Dividend Example</div>
  <p>A company has $100 par 8% cumulative preferred stock. It misses dividends for 2 years, then wants to pay a common dividend in year 3.</p>
  <p>Before paying common shareholders anything, it must pay:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Year 1 arrears: $8</li>
    <li>Year 2 arrears: $8</li>
    <li>Year 3 current: $8</li>
    <li><strong>Total per share: $24</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Adjustable-Rate (Variable/Floating) Preferred

<span class="key-term">Adjustable-rate preferred</span> pays dividends tied to a benchmark rate (like Treasury bills). The dividend rises and falls with market rates.

The trade-off: income fluctuates, but because the dividend adjusts with rates, the share price remains relatively stable. This provides <span class="key-term">preservation of capital</span> for investors who prioritize stability over fixed income.

#### Callable Preferred

<span class="key-term">Callable preferred</span> can be redeemed by the issuer after a set date, typically at par. Companies call preferred stock when interest rates fall—they retire the old higher-rate shares and issue new preferred at lower rates.

To compensate for this call risk, callable preferred typically pays higher dividends than noncallable issues.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Sinking Funds</div>
  <p>Issuers of callable preferred (and callable bonds) often establish sinking funds—money set aside specifically to retire these securities. This reassures investors that the issuer will have funds available when they want to call.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Common stock is never callable. Only preferred stock and bonds can be called.</p>
</div>

#### Convertible Preferred

<span class="key-term">Convertible preferred</span> can be exchanged for common stock at a predetermined conversion ratio. If the common stock price rises significantly, the convertible preferred rises with it.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The price of convertible preferred is primarily driven by the price of the underlying common stock, not by interest rates like regular preferred. If a question asks what drives convertible preferred pricing, think about the common stock.</p>
</div>

Because of the conversion feature's value, convertible preferred typically pays lower dividends than non-convertible issues. Convertibles may also be callable or subject to forced conversion if the common stock stays above a certain price.

#### Participating Preferred

<span class="key-term">Participating preferred</span> receives its fixed dividend plus potentially additional dividends when declared by the board. This allows shareholders to participate more fully in company profits during strong earnings years.

### Topic 3: Interest Rate Movements and Preferred Stock Prices

#### The Inverse Relationship

When preferred stock is issued, the dividend rate is set comparable to current market interest rates for similar securities. Once issued, the market price will fluctuate primarily based on interest rate movements.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">The Iron Law of Fixed-Income Securities</div>
  <p>There is an <strong>inverse relationship</strong> between interest rates and preferred stock prices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When interest rates <strong>RISE</strong>, preferred stock prices <strong>FALL</strong></li>
    <li>When interest rates <strong>FALL</strong>, preferred stock prices <strong>RISE</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This same relationship applies to bonds. The logic: if new preferred stock offers 8% and you hold preferred paying 6%, your shares must fall in price to offer buyers a competitive yield.</p>
</div>

#### Current Yield Calculation

<span class="key-term">Current yield</span> measures the return an investor earns based on what they actually paid:

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Current Yield = Annual Income ÷ Market Price</div>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Current Yield Example</div>
  <p>10% preferred stock ($100 par) trades at $90 per share.</p>
  <p>Annual dividend = $10 ($100 × 10%)</p>
  <p>Current Yield = $10 ÷ $90 = 11.1%</p>
  <p>The current yield (11.1%) exceeds the stated dividend rate (10%) because the investor bought at a discount. Buying below par increases your effective yield.</p>
</div>

## Section 5: Special Securities

Beyond common stock, preferred stock, and rights, several other equity-related securities appear on the Series 7 exam. Two deserve special attention: warrants and American Depositary Receipts.

---

### Topic 1: Warrants

In 1911, AT&T issued the first publicly traded warrants to make a bond offering more attractive. The concept worked: investors got a "sweetener" that might become valuable if AT&T's stock price rose. Today, warrants remain a common way to make new issues more appealing.

#### What Warrants Are

A <span class="key-term">warrant</span> gives the holder the right to buy stock at a fixed price—typically set well above the current market price when issued. Warrants only become valuable if the stock price rises above the exercise price.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Warrant Example</div>
  <p>A company issues a bond with one warrant attached. The common stock trades at $20. The warrant allows purchase of one share at $30, expiring in 5 years.</p>
  <p>At issuance, this warrant has no immediate value—why pay $30 when you can buy shares for $20? But if the stock rises to $50 within 5 years, that warrant lets you buy at $30 for an instant $20 profit.</p>
</div>

Warrants are sometimes called "sweeteners" because they make the underlying security more attractive to investors. Although received as part of a unit, warrants trade separately as their own securities.

#### Warrants vs. Rights

Both warrants and rights can be traded, exercised, or allowed to expire worthless. The differences:

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Rights</th>
      <th>Warrants</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Exercise Price</td>
      <td>Below current market</td>
      <td>Above current market</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Duration</td>
      <td>Short-term (30-60 days)</td>
      <td>Long-term (5-10 years) or perpetual</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intrinsic Value at Issue</td>
      <td>Yes (below market price)</td>
      <td>No (above market price)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Time Value</td>
      <td>Minimal (short duration)</td>
      <td>Significant (long duration)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Warrants, rights, and convertible securities are not considered equity until exercised or converted into common stock. Until then, they're derivative securities.</p>
</div>

#### Perpetual Warrants

Most warrants expire in 5-10 years, but <span class="key-term">perpetual warrants</span> never expire. These are rare but occasionally appear on exams.

### Topic 2: American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)

#### The Problem ADRs Solve

Foreign companies that want U.S. investors face a challenge: listing directly on U.S. exchanges is expensive and requires extensive regulatory compliance. <span class="key-term">American Depositary Receipts</span> offer an elegant workaround.

#### How ADRs Work

1. A U.S. bank purchases foreign stock and holds it in trust in the country of origin
2. The bank issues ADRs representing those shares
3. ADRs are registered with the SEC and trade in U.S. markets, priced in U.S. dollars

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">ADR Example</div>
  <p>You want to invest in a German automaker but don't want to deal with euros or German exchanges. You buy ADRs through your U.S. broker, priced in dollars, settling through normal U.S. channels. The underlying shares sit in a German custodial bank, but you never interact with them directly.</p>
</div>

#### ADR Holder Rights

ADR holders receive dividends—converted to U.S. dollars by the custodian bank. However, they don't have voting rights (the bank votes the underlying shares) or preemptive rights (the bank sells any rights and passes the proceeds to ADR holders).

#### Exchange Rate Risk

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Currency Risk in ADRs</div>
  <p>Although ADRs are priced in U.S. dollars, their value depends partly on exchange rates. This <span class="key-term">exchange rate risk</span> (or <span class="key-term">currency risk</span>) means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the foreign currency <strong>weakens</strong> against the dollar, ADR value <strong>falls</strong></li>
    <li>If the foreign currency <strong>strengthens</strong> against the dollar, ADR value <strong>rises</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>An ADR investor is exposed to two risks: the performance of the underlying company AND currency fluctuations.</p>
</div>

(Currency risk is why many U.S. investors wake up to find their international holdings moved 2% overnight while they slept—the company did nothing, but the yen did.)
