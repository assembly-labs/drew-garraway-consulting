# Chapter 16: Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) - Raw Notes

## Overview

The Maloney Act of 1938 established non-exchange self-regulatory organizations (SROs). Today, there are two such SROs:
- **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**
- **Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)**

All SROs are supervised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); all SRO rules must be approved by the SEC.

## SECTION 1: FINRA RULES

### Key Concepts
- FINRA Registration and Supervisory Rules
- Additional Rules for Registered Persons
- Customer Disputes and FINRA Violations
- Communications with the Public
- FINRA Conduct Rules

---

### Topic 1: FINRA Registration and Supervisory Rules

#### Registered Representatives (RRs)
Required qualifications include:
- Individuals who solicit orders
- Individuals who train others to solicit orders
- Supervisors of these activities
- Individuals responsible for supervising financial services offered by RRs in the BD
- Individuals with signature or approval authority for customer accounts

Must register with an appropriate exam within 4 months or lose registration.

#### SIE and Registered Representative (RR) Exams
- SIE exam must pass first for initial entry
- If sponsored by a member firm, they become an associated person and must pass the representative exam
- Qualifications exam, once passed, satisfies both exams' registration requirements
- Registration is valid for a lifetime unless they are let go (terminated)
- Must maintain registration to transfer; for an associated person, registration must be maintained

#### Form U4
- Must be submitted within 30 days of passing exams
- Includes applicant and firm information
- Creates record with CRD

#### Fingerprinting
- Applies to most securities professionals
- Exceptions apply when employee does not handle cash or securities

#### BrokerCheck
- FINRA resource for investors
- Provides information on firms, representatives, and disciplinary actions

#### "Paying for a seat" terminology
- For NYSE have to buy a "seat" but this term no longer applies to FINRA
- The applicant must be a good standing

#### Main Office vs Branch Office
- **Main Office**: Required for every broker-dealer, needs supervisory principal
- **Branch Office**: Location where BD conducts customer securities activities, requires branch office manager

#### Branch Office Locations and Chain of Command
- Every branch must have a registered representative assigned as OSJ manager
- OSJ = Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction - where supervisory responsibilities are carried out
- Principal can supervise one or more OSJs
- Not every branch requires a registered principal (but the OSJ does)

#### The Supervisory System
- Supervision through ongoing review of accounts
- Firms must have written supervisory procedures
- Reasonable reliance on reports from others within the firm
- Exception reports - flags unusual activity
- Annual Compliance Meeting required
- Firms must conduct periodic inspections

#### Supervisory Control System Elements
- Identify Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction, designate and name the OSJ manager
- Establish a reasonable system for supervision
- Conduct at least annual inspection of each office and the supervisory system
- Review and endorse transactions, correspondence, customer complaints, and other activities
- Separate supervisory responsibilities

#### Written Supervisory Procedures
- In effect at all times
- Subject matter procedures must be kept at each site
- Must be updated annually
- All employees must have access

#### Annual Compliance Meeting
- FINRA Rule requires that firms hold annual compliance meeting
- Every registered person must attend
- Topics covered: firm policies, regulatory updates, training

---

### Topic 2: Additional Rules for Registered Persons

#### Outside Business Activities
- FINRA requires registered persons to provide prompt written notice of any outside business activities to their employer
- Includes any activity with compensation (including board membership, family business, part-time jobs)
- Exception: charitable work without compensation
- Firms may approve or disapprove

#### Passive Investments
- Passive investments are exempt from this rule
- A passive investment = person invests but plays no active role
- Example: becoming a limited partner in a DPP is passive investment

#### Fidelity Bond Coverage
- Each member firm must maintain fidelity bond coverage on all employees
- Protects against loss from employee theft or misappropriation

#### Continuing Education Requirements
- **Regulatory element**: Requires that FINRA-created computerized training session be completed annually. If not completed within required time, that person's registration is suspended until complete
- **Firm element**: Requires an annual training plan prepared and implemented by member firms, covering relevant products, regulations, and compliance issues

#### Leaving and Rejoining the Securities Industry
- If associated person leaves firm, regardless of reason, firm must file **Form U5** within 30 days
- A copy of Form U5 must be provided to terminated individual
- Person's FINRA registration terminates at same time as employment
- Registration not reinstated until another firm registers the individual through new Form U4
- Generally, if person spends 2+ years without being associated with firm, must requalify by taking exam(s)
- FINRA prohibits firms from extending this 2-year period by "parking" or "hanging" an individual's registration
- However, FINRA's **Maintaining Qualifications Program (MQP)** allows extending this period from 2 to 5 years by completing annual CE; available only to associated persons who have been registered for one year or longer

#### FINRA Jurisdiction
- FINRA maintains jurisdiction over associated person for 2 years after Form U5 is processed
- Person can be subject to FINRA disciplinary proceedings or arbitration for the person's actions before leaving the industry

#### Military Service
- FINRA provides special accommodations for registered persons who enter active military service
- Upon notification to FINRA, individual is placed on inactive status
- While inactive, firm may allow them to continue receiving commissions on customer accounts
- They cannot perform regular duties
- FINRA also suspends Continuing Education requirements
- The 2-year termination clock is **tolled (paused)** until 90 days after person leaves military service

#### Packaged Product Compensation Rules
- Compensation received from selling pooled investment vehicles (variable annuities, mutual funds, DPPs) is strictly regulated
- No associated person may accept compensation from anyone other than their employer, unless all following conditions apply:
  - Their firm agrees to arrangement
  - Payments are made through employing firm
  - Firm follows SEC compensation rules
  - Firm maintains records of all compensation received from issuers or sponsors
  - Records must include: representative names, amount of cash compensation, and any non-cash compensation

- Firms and representatives selling investment company securities or variable contracts may NOT accept securities as compensation
- Any cash compensation must be described in current prospectus

##### Non-Cash Compensation Exceptions
- Gifts that do not exceed $100 in value per year
- Gratuities, such as meals or theater tickets, that are not frequent or expensive
- Payments or reimbursements for attending training or educational events (payments are not allowed for guests)
- Compensation not based on sales targets of a specific brand or individual product

##### Incentive Compensation Rules
Permitted if ALL conditions are met:
1. Incentives are based on total sales of all securities distributed by firm
2. Credit given for each sale is equally weighted
3. No unaffiliated firm participates in arrangement
4. All recordkeeping requirements are met

---

### Topic 3: Customer Disputes and FINRA Violations

#### Customer Complaints
- **Customer complaint** = any written statement from customer alleging grievance involving activities of firm or representatives related to solicitation or execution of a securities transaction
- A principal must handle all complaints, no matter how minor
- Firms must report to FINRA upon learning that firm or associated person is subject of either:
  - Complaints involving allegations of theft, forgery, or misappropriation of funds
  - Claims for damages over $15,000 when filed against associated person or $25,000 when filed against the member firm

- Reports must be made no later than 30 days after the member firm has learned or should have learned of the event
- Firms must report statistical and summary information regarding all written customer complaints in as much detail as FINRA may specify
- Firms must file these reports by the 15th day of month following the calendar quarter in which complaint was received

#### Record Retention
All written customer complaints must be recorded by the firm and kept in a separate file. The records must include any action taken by the firm in response. Customer complaint records must be maintained at the Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction (OSJ) for a minimum of 4 years. (The MSRB requires a 6-year retention period.)

Firms must also keep a separate file of customer complaints related to options, index warrants, currency index warrants, or currency index warrants.

#### FINRA Code of Arbitration
- Customer disputes over money that cannot be resolved are generally handled by arbitration
- Customer must agree by signing an arbitration agreement as part of the new account process
- If no arbitration agreement was signed, customer can sue the broker-dealer

##### Arbitration Process
- If customer agrees to arbitration, a FINRA arbitration panel will hear the dispute and determine if any damages are due
- 3-person panel may be composed of: majority of public arbitrators (people who have no connection to the securities industry), or if customer chooses, an arbitration panel that consists of all public arbitrators
- Arbitrators' findings are final and binding on all parties
- Decision cannot be appealed unless alleged criminal behavior is involved

##### Broker-Dealer Customer Account Agreements
- Typically contain a predispute arbitration clause
- Requires customers to arbitrate any future disputes with firm
- FINRA requires the firm to: highlight any predispute arbitration clause, provide clause in simple language that explains how arbitration works and that customers are waiving their right to sue

##### Mediation
- Can be used as alternative to arbitration
- Offers option of having the dispute heard by a single mediator
- Both sides must agree to use of mediator
- Either side can withdraw at any time
- Mediator's decision is not binding
- If use of the mediator is abandoned, the dispute is returned to the arbitration process

##### Registered Representative Disputes
- Handled by **binding arbitration**
- Any dispute between registered representative and their firm must be resolved by binding arbitration, which cannot be appealed
- The representative agreed to this when they signed the Form U4
- Note: Rules prohibit discrimination, sexual harassment, and whistleblower claims from being excluded from mandatory requirement

#### FINRA Code of Procedure

##### Complaint Filed with FINRA Department of Enforcement
- Code of Procedure details the process for handling various customer grievances against member firms or associated persons that involve a violation of FINRA rules
- Process starts with filing a complaint with the FINRA Department of Enforcement (DOE)
- DOE investigates the complaint
- If it believes it has merit, complaint is forwarded to FINRA Office of Hearing Officers (OHO)
- OHO sends to member firm or associated person for response
- Response to complaint must be filed with OHO within approximately one month
- Once the response is filed, the OHO determines if a violation occurred and what penalties, if any, will be imposed

**Note**: A disciplinary proceeding brought under the Code of Procedure is different from an arbitration claim. Under the Code of Arbitration, customer brings the claim to get monetary award. Under the Code of Procedure, the DOE determines whether to pursue a complaint, with the purpose of punishing violations.

#### FINRA Hearing Panel
- If the complainant is not satisfied with the response and OHO determination, the respondent can request a hearing in front of a FINRA hearing panel at mutually agreed-upon location
- After the hearing, a decision is made

##### Appeal Process
1. **First appeal - National Adjudicatory Council (NAC)**: If either party is displeased with the hearing panel decision, an appeal can be made to the NAC, which FINRA operates out of its headquarters in Maryland
2. **Second appeal - SEC**: After the NAC conducts a hearing, either party can appeal the decision to the SEC
3. **Final appeal - federal court**: After the SEC reaches a decision, either party can appeal to federal court

#### Penalties
Once a decision is final, FINRA determines the appropriate penalty:
- Censure
- Suspension
- Expulsion
- Fines of amounts proportionate to the offense

For criminal offenses, case is forwarded to the SEC and handled by the Department of Justice (DOJ). FINRA cannot impose criminal penalties, such as jail time.

#### Minor Complaints - Maximum $2,500 Fine
- For complaints that the DOE considers to be minor, it may prepare and request that the respondent sign a **Minor Rule Violation (MRV)** letter accepting the finding of violation
- Under this procedure, the respondent admits guilt to a minor offense, as detailed in the letter, and is subject to a maximum $2,500 fine

**Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC)**: The respondent accepts the findings, waives their right to appeal, and consents to any penalty. They do not admit guilt.

- FINRA permits these gifts:
  - Occasional gifts of de minimis value if records are kept
  - Promotional items - pens, caps, apparel with firm logo

**Note**: The above applies to representatives between BD/RRs. This differs from the $100 per customer per year that falls under the SEC's rules.

## SECTION 2: MSRB RULES

### Overview
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) was established to create rules and regulations covering:
- Broker-dealers
- Underwriters
- Investment advisers
- Their representatives who deal in municipal securities

It also creates exams for municipal securities representatives, advisers, and principal supervisors.

Many MSRB rules are similar to FINRA rules. This section focuses on areas that are specific to the MSRB.

### Key Concepts
- MSRB Jurisdiction
- MSRB Qualification and Conduct of Customer Account Rules
- MSRB Trading and Market Rules
- MSRB Advertising and Political Contribution Rules

---

### Topic 1: MSRB Jurisdiction, Qualification, and Customer Account Rules

#### Jurisdiction of the MSRB
- The MSRB is the self-regulatory organization (SRO) that makes the rules for the municipal securities industry
- These rules apply to:
  - Banks
  - Brokers engaged in municipal activities
  - Dealers engaged in municipal activities
  - Registered representatives of these firms

**Test Taking Tip**: The MSRB has no regulatory authority over municipal issuers. It can only influence the behavior of municipal professionals by setting the rules for the firms that deal with municipalities, for underwriting, advising, and other functions.

Like FINRA, the MSRB requires approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for any rules it creates. But, unlike FINRA, the MSRB does not enforce its own rules. For broker-dealers, enforcement of MSRB rules is carried out by:
- SEC
- FINRA
- The SEC

For non-broker-dealer banks, MSRB rules are enforced by:
- Federal Reserve Board (the Fed)
- Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
- Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)

**Test Taking Tip**: While the MSRB creates regulations for the municipal market, it does not have the ability to enforce its own rules.

#### Differences between the SEC, FINRA, and MSRB

| | SEC | FINRA | MSRB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Type of entity | Federal agency | SRO | SRO |
| Writes rules | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Enforces rules | Yes | Yes | No |
| Specific functions | - Oversees SROs - Registers investment companies - Regulates securities offerings | - Qualifies representatives - Conducts arbitration and investigation - Operates CRD system | - Establishes professional standards - Establishes ethical standards - Has no enforcement power |

---

### Topic 2: MSRB Trading and Market Rules

#### Uniform Practice Code
Like FINRA, the MSRB has established a Uniform Practice Code to cover secondary market transactions. These requirements include:

- **Regular way settlement** = first business day after the trade date (T+1); Cash transactions settle on the trade date
- **Good delivery** requires that securities be in good physical condition and be properly endorsed
- **Receiving firm** must provide written notice if securities were not properly delivered
- **Published quotes** must generally be firm bids or offers
- **Requests for bids** and offers, as well as nominal bids, are allowed, but they must be labeled
- Quotes must be based on a broker-dealer's best judgment that the price represents fair market value
- **Transactions** must be reported to the MSRB's Real-Time Transaction Reporting System (RTRS)

#### Trade Confirmation
Customers must be sent a written confirmation at or before the completion of a trade. Confirmations must include:
- The name, address, and telephone number of the broker-dealer
- The customer's name
- If the trade was a purchase or sale, and whether the firm was acting as principal or agent
- The trade date and time of execution
- Par value and Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number, settlement date, yield, and dollar price
- The total dollar amount, including the amount of accrued interest
- Markup must be disclosed on certain principal transactions

#### Determining Fair Market Value
- All quotes must represent prices that are determined using the dealer's best judgment of the **fair market value** at the time of the quote
- Quote must have reasonable relationship to fair market value, considering all relevant factors, including:
  - Overall inventory position
  - Inventory position in that security
  - Anticipation of the direction of the movement of the market for the securities
  - Knowledge of facts about the issue (such as the fact that the security has been called or that the issuer has announced a default)

#### Municipal Quotes
- A municipal firm is permitted to quote a security that it does not own as long as the firm is prepared to sell that security at the stated price
- If the firm knows that the security is not available in the market, then giving that quote would be prohibited

#### Bids Wanted (BW) and Offers Wanted (OW)
- These are acceptable quotes
- Also referred to as **nominal** or **subject quotes**
- They must be identified appropriately as such
- A nominal quote is a quote given for informational purposes only

#### Example - Workable Quote
A firm wants to sell some bonds and starts shopping the market for bids. The first dealer called says, "I think I might buy them at about 5.00 basis." This is known as a **workable quote** - the dealer is giving a likely price at which they might buy the bonds - but this is not a firm quote.

#### Fictitious Trade Reports
- The MSRB prohibits broker-dealers from reporting a municipal security trade unless it is known that an actual transaction occurred at that price
- Fictitious trade reports are considered to be a deceptive and manipulative practice
- All municipal trades must be reported to the MSRB's Real-Time Transaction Reporting System (RTRS)

#### Obligation to Obtain the Best Price in a Trade
- When executing municipal transactions for customers, every broker-dealer is obligated to obtain a price for the customer that is fair and reasonable in relation to prevailing market conditions
- Note that the rule does not require firms to secure the best price; it only requires that the price be fair and reasonable and reflects current market conditions for that security

#### Prices to Customers
Prices charged to customers must be fair and reasonable. Key points to know about this rule are:
- Pricing must be based on current market value
- Dealers are entitled to make a profit
- An issue's liquidity has a major impact on pricing

#### Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) System
- EMMA is an MSRB-created website established specifically for retail customer use
- Gives municipal investors free access to municipal disclosure documents and municipal price reporting

The information that the investing public can find on EMMA includes:
- New municipal issue offering documents (official statements) for most municipal bond issues, notes, and 529 plans
- Details of bonds that have been pre-refunded
- Ongoing disclosures by municipal issuers about their finances, including material event notices and annual financial information
- Real-time prices and yields for municipal bond trades, as reported through RTRS (Real-Time Transaction Reporting System) and SHORT (Short-Term Obligation Rate Transparency system)

EMMA also includes an investor education site.

#### New Issues
In offerings of new municipal issues, broker-dealers are required to disclose or send the following to customers:
- **Final official statement, if prepared**: A final official statement (disclosure document) must be sent to customers no later than settlement of the transaction. If one is not being prepared, a written notice to this effect must be sent to the customer.
- **Additional disclosures in negotiated offerings**: For negotiated offerings, the underwriting spread, the amount of any fees received in connection with the underwriting, and the initial offering price of each maturity must be disclosed. Note that competitive bid underwritings do not require disclosure of this information to customers.

The rules require that these documents be furnished promptly to any other broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer who makes the request. Underwriters must submit official statements and other relevant documents to EMMA, and they must provide customers with links to these documents. Underwriters must also confirm whether a continuing disclosure agreement exists and provide the date when annual financial disclosures will be available in EMMA.

#### Underwriter Responsibilities
- Underwriters may advertise initial reoffering prices or yields if the advertisement contains the date of the issuer's sale to the syndicate and a disclaimer that the securities may be made available at a price or yield different from those shown in the advertisement
- Advertisements must be approved in writing by a municipal securities or general securities principal before first use and kept on file

#### CUSIP Numbers
- A dealer is a supervisory system must apply for a CUSIP number, which is used to identify the securities being offered
- For a negotiated sale, the CUSIP must be obtained once pricing is finalized
- For a competitive sale, the CUSIP must be obtained once the underwriter has been selected

#### 529 and ABLE Plans
- Underwriters of 529 plans and Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) plans must report information, including performance data, to the MSRB
- Information reports must be filed semi-annually, and performance data must be reported annually
- Performance data must cover the most recent calendar year and be compared against the performance of an appropriate benchmark
- A record of the filing must be kept for a minimum of 6 years

---

### Topic 3: MSRB Advertising and Political Contribution Rules

#### MSRB Definition of Advertising
The MSRB defines "advertising" as any material designed for use in the public media or any promotional literature intended to be disseminated to the public. Included in the MSRB's definition are notices, offering circulars, form letters, market letters, reports, and other materials that will be distributed to the public. Advertising cannot omit material facts or contain false or misleading statements.

**Test-Taking Tip**: Internal memos are excluded from the definition.

#### Official Statements are Excluded
- Official statements are excluded; abstracts are included
- Official statements from the MSRB's definition of advertising
- These don't need to be subject to MSRB advertising rules because other MSRB rules already govern their content and accuracy
- However, abstracts or summaries of official statements are included under this definition, because the MSRB is concerned about the completeness and accuracy of such abbreviated documents

#### Requirements for Municipal Bond Advertisements
Advertisements for municipal bonds are subject to the following requirements:
- If the advertisement shows yields or prices of bonds trading in the secondary market, the ad must reflect those prices or yields at the time that the ad is published ("stale" prices are prohibited)
- If a percentage rate is shown, it must be stated whether this is the nominal (coupon) rate or yield; it must also be stated whether the yields shown are before-tax or after-tax

#### Dealer Inventory Advertising
Dealers are permitted to advertise municipal bonds that they do not have in inventory as long as:
- The securities advertised are described as subject to availability
- The dealer is not aware that the bonds are no longer available in the secondary market
- The dealer would attempt to acquire the bonds if contacted by a customer
- The advertisement states that the bonds are subject to change in yield or price

#### Approval and Retention Requirements
- **Approval in advance of use by a principal; retained for 4 years**: Every municipal advertisement must be approved in advance of first use by a Municipal Securities Principal (Series 53) or General Securities Principal (Series 24)
- Unlike FINRA, which requires that advertisements be retained for three years, the MSRB sets a four-year retention period

#### Political Contributions

##### The MSRB Rule
The MSRB rule states that a municipal firm or municipal finance professional (MFP) can only contribute a maximum of $250 to a political campaign in which the MFP is entitled to vote. If more is given, the firm is prohibited from conducting municipal finance business with that issuer for 2 years.

##### Municipal Finance Professional (MFP)
An MFP is a registered person who performs financial advisory work or underwriting for municipal issuers. A registered representative who deals with retail clients is not considered to be an MFP and is not subject to this rule. However, a registered representative who negotiates underwriting terms with a municipal issuer is defined as an MFP and is subject to the rule.

Under the rule, an MFP can give up to $250 per election campaign in which the MFP is entitled to vote without a resulting 2-year ban. However, suppose the MFP gives more than $250 to an elected official's campaign in which the MFP is entitled to vote, or gives any dollar amount to an elected official's campaign in which the MFP is not entitled to vote. In that case, the employing member firm will be banned from engaging in municipal securities business with that issuer for two years.
