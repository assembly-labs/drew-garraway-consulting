# Chapter 14: Primary Market - Raw Notes

## Section 1: The Securities Act of 1933

### Introduction

- First federal securities regulation passed in response to stock market crash of 1929 and worldwide
  depression
- Covers the PRIMARY MARKET (where corporations and government entities raise money by selling
  securities to investors)
- Contrasts with SECONDARY MARKET (where securities are traded among investors)
- Primary market sometimes referred to as the CAPITAL MARKET (where longer-term funding is raised
  for issuers)

### Key Concepts

- Requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
- Securities and Transactions Exempt from the Securities Act of 1933

### Topic 1: Requirements of the Securities Act of 1933

**Two Main Purposes:**

1. Require companies to publicly disclose all relevant financial information about securities before
   offering for sale
2. Prohibit fraud and deceit in the sale of securities

**Registration Statement:**

- Nonexempt securities must be registered with federal government before being offered for sale to
  public
- First step: file a registration statement with regulators
- Contains key information:
  - Details about company's business operation
  - Information about management of the company
  - Description of the security being offered
  - Plans for how the money raised will be used
  - Financial statements certified by independent accountants

**Investment Banker (Underwriter):**

- Usually filed by company with help of investment banker (broker-dealer specializing in
  underwriting securities)
- In most cases, underwriter purchases securities from issuer at a discount, then sells to public at
  a fixed public offering price

**Prospectus:**

- Part of registration statement serves as a disclosure document to investors
- Provides information potential investors need to decide whether to invest
- Registration statements and forms filed with SEC (established 1934)
- Investors and public can access via SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval
  (EDGAR) system

**SEC Review:**

- Regulators examine registration statement to ensure legal requirements are met
- Until SEC determines security has met registration requirements, securities may not be sold or
  offered for sale
- **TEST TIP:** SEC does NOT "approve" securities - it simply registers them and allows them to be
  sold

**Effective Date:**

- Once SEC registers securities (the "effective date"), securities may be sold to public at public
  offering price
- Price must appear on prospectus
- Copy of prospectus must be sent to customer at or before an offer or sale of any registered
  primary offering

### Topic 2: Securities and Transactions Exempt from the Securities Act of 1933

## Section 2: Underwriting a Primary Offering

### Introduction

- Various types of primary offerings
- Issuers usually hire an investment banker to help manage the offering and market and sell the
  securities being offered

### Key Concepts

- Types of Public Offerings
- The Underwriting Agreement
- The Underwriting Timeline
- The Underwriting Process

### Topic 1: Types of Public Offerings

**Primary Market:**

- When new securities are sold to public for first time, proceeds go to ISSUER
- If company never issued common stock before, first offering = Initial Public Offering (IPO)
- Investment banker acts as underwriter to market and sell shares

**Secondary Market:**

- Once shares registered and purchased in public offering, they can trade freely
- Market where shares are bought and sold = secondary market
- Proceeds go to SELLER, not issuer

**Follow-on Offering:**

- If company decides to sell additional shares after IPO, it's a follow-on offering
- Also a primary offering (issuer sells shares to public)
- Can be for various reasons: successful company funding growth, struggling company needing cash
- Also known as: additional issue offerings, add-ons, subsequent offerings, seasoned equity
  offerings

**Secondary Offering:**

- When a large shareholder (institutional investor, senior executive) wants to sell a large number
  of shares to public
- Sale may be handled by underwriter similar to primary offering
- This is called a SECONDARY OFFERING
- In secondary offering, SHAREHOLDER (not issuer) receives proceeds

**Split Offering (Combination/Combined Offering):**

- Combines sales by large shareholders with additional shares from issuer
- Portion of proceeds goes to shareholder(s) and a portion to issuer

**Shelf Registration:**

- Allows an issuer to file one registration statement for a large number of securities
- Some may be offered immediately, others put "on a shelf" and sold later when market favorable
- Valid for up to 3 YEARS
- Securities can be postponed for up to 3 years before having to file new registration statement
- Offering registered via shelf registration = SHELF OFFERING

**Public Offerings:**

- All these offerings involve offering and selling securities to the general public
- Securities offered to public must be REGISTERED

**Private Offering (Private Placement):**

- To avoid cost and time of registration, issuer may offer unregistered securities to private group
  of investors
- Called a PRIVATE OFFERING or PRIVATE PLACEMENT

### Topic 2: The Underwriting Agreement

**Underwriting Commitments:**

- Company decides to issue and sell securities to public, typically hires investment bank to act as
  underwriter
- Underwriter helps company through registration process
- Once securities registered, underwriter will market and sell securities to public

**Selecting the Underwriter:**

- Two basic methods:
  1. **Negotiated underwriting:** Issuer chooses underwriter and negotiates terms of contract. Most
     common for corporate underwriting.
  2. **Competitive bid:** Issuer solicits bids from multiple firms. Firm willing to underwrite at
     lowest cost wins. Common for municipal securities but rare for corporate.

**TEST TIP:** Assume a general obligation bond will use a competitive bid process.

**Underwriting Commitments (Types):**

- Once underwriter chosen, issuer and underwriter enter into underwriting agreement
- Two basic types of underwriting commitments:
  1. **Firm commitment**
  2. **Best efforts**

**Firm Commitment:**

- Underwriter purchases all securities at a discount from issuer, then sells to public at public
  offering price
- Underwriter assumes ALL risk of the offering, including liability for unsold shares
- Underwriter is acting as PRINCIPAL in the transaction
- Most common type for corporate offerings, most issuers prefer it

**Standby Underwriting:**

- Type of firm commitment used when company attempts to sell additional shares to existing
  shareholders through a rights offering
- If existing shareholders don't subscribe, underwriter will "stand by" on firm commitment basis to
  purchase unsubscribed shares at subscription price
- Underwriter can then reoffer shares to general public

**Conditions for Standby Agreement:**

- Underwriters and syndicate members (group of broker-dealers handling IPO sale) generally may not
  retain shares of an IPO for their accounts to sell at later time
- However, underwriters may purchase unsold shares of IPO under standby agreement if the following
  conditions are met:
  - It is disclosed in the prospectus
  - It is stated in a written agreement
  - A statement from lead underwriter attests it couldn't find any buyers
  - The shares will not be sold for 3 months

**Underwriters' Accounts:**

- Underwriters may also place a portion of issue in their accounts if specified in the underwriting
  agreement and they are unable to sell shares to the public
- If syndicate unable to sell all shares being offered, syndicate members are financially
  responsible for remaining shares
- Shares will be divided based on agreements among underwriters

**Two Methods for Allocating Unsold Shares:**

1. **Western (or Divided) Account:** Share of liability is divided among underwriters based on size
   of their initial allotment shares. Syndicate members financially responsible for ONLY shares they
   were allotted.
2. **Eastern (or Undivided) Account:** Syndicate members are JOINTLY responsible, even if unsold
   shares were not the shares they were allotted.

**Best-Efforts Underwritings:**

- If issuer is smaller, lesser-known company, underwriter may not be willing to take on risk of firm
  commitment
- Underwriter may prefer a BEST-EFFORTS COMMITMENT
- Underwriter agrees to use its best efforts to sell issuer's securities, but does NOT guarantee all
  shares will be sold
- Underwriter is acting as an AGENT in the transaction
- Underwriter is NOT financially responsible for securities it does not sell
- Best-efforts commitments are common for private offerings

**Two types of best-efforts commitments:**

1. **All-or-none (AON):** If underwriter is not able to sell ALL the securities, the offering is
   canceled
2. **Mini-max:** Underwriter must be able to sell a MINIMUM amount of the offering. If minimum sold,
   underwriter will continue to try to sell remainder on best-efforts basis.

**Escrow Account (Best-Efforts):**

- In a best-efforts commitment, SEC requires investors' payments be deposited into a separate escrow
  account of an independent bank
- Ensures investors will get their money back if offering is canceled
- In a firm commitment underwriting, underwriter pays negotiated price to issuer and is also
  responsible for any unsold shares, so NO escrow account is required

### Topic 3: The Underwriting Timeline

**Registration Statement:**

- The initial step is the process of filing a registration statement
- The statement is filed on a Form S-1 for securities registered under 1933 Act
- Initial filing begins the review/registration process
- Registration statement also includes company information, uses of proceeds, risk factors,
  underwriting details, and selling shareholders

**Pre-Filing Period:**

- The pre-filing period is the time before the issuer files the registration statement
- The registration statement will be included in a form provided by the SEC for this purpose
- The application serves as the included files in the pre-filing period, including:
  - Company information and business
  - Description of the security to be offered
  - Planned use of proceeds
  - The selling off period
  - Financial statements certified by independent accountants

**Cooling-Off Period:**

- During the cooling-off period, SEC has 20 days (minimum) to review the registration
- This period is called the cooling-off period (waiting for the registration statement to become
  effective)
- If deficiencies found, SEC sends deficiency letter, time period restarts
- Amended info is an amendment to the registration statement
- If no deficiencies, or after corrected, registration statement becomes effective

**Note:** The preliminary prospectus can not be used in the pre-filing period. So, in the pre-filing
period, the primary market has to wait.

**TEST TIP:** The preliminary prospectus does not contain the public offering price.

**Pre-Filing Period Activities:**

- Prior to filing, an issuer can conduct certain due diligence and prepare to file statement to
  begin registration process
- Issuers CANNOT offer or sell securities before registration statement becomes effective

**What's NOT Allowed in Pre-Filing Period:**

- No oral solicitation of customers
- No distribution of written material offering securities for sale
- No "soft-circling" or expressions of interest

**Indications of Interest:**

- Representatives can't say they will accept an order in the pre-filing period, but investors can
  say they may want to be called when the offering price is fixed
- This "expression of interest" is NOT a commitment to buy
- Used to help gauge demand and set price

**Initial Communications:**

- During cooling-off period, the issuer and underwriter can make initial communications on a very
  limited basis to test interest in a POTENTIAL offering
- Limited communications: company name, type of security, contemplated price range, name of
  underwriter
- Referred to as "testing the waters"

**Registration Timeline:**

| Phase            | Ordinary Period Securities               | IPO Securities           |

- Protects against liability under antifraud provisions

**All Information Gathered:**

- Once SEC examines and approves registration, SEC issues release to announce to underwriters it's
  effective
- This is called going effective

### Post-Effective Period

**After Registration:**

- Once registration statement becomes effective (obtained by SEC), firm's compliance is now
  understood for selling of securities
- This starts the post-effective period

**The Final Prospectus:**

- Once SEC releases offer, must contain final prospectus
- Final prospectus contains all information plus:
  - Final public offering price

| Due diligence     | Indications of interest                  | Final prospectus required |

### Topic 4: The Underwriting Process

**Underwriting Spread:**

- When a company issues new securities via a public offering, investment banker/underwriter
  purchases the securities from issuer at a discount
- Underwriter resells to public at public offering price (POP)
- Difference = underwriting spread (or underwriter's compensation/gross spread)

**Components of the Spread:**

- Manager's fee: Goes to managing underwriter for organizing deal
- Underwriting fee: Goes to syndicate members for taking risk
- Selling concession: Goes to whoever sells the shares (largest portion of spread)

**Example:**

- $110 million shares × $10 POP = $100 million offering
- If underwriting spread = $0.70/share:
  - Managing fee: $0.10/share (10 million shares = $1 million)
  - Underwriting fee: $0.10/share ($1 million)
  - Selling concession: $0.50/share ($5 million)
  - Total spread: $7 million

**Underwriters' Spread:** | Component | Amount | Total | |-----------|--------|-------| | Managing
fee | $0.10/share | $1 million | | Underwriting | $0.10/share | $1 million | | Selling | $0.50/share
| $5 million | | **Total** | $0.70/share | $7 million |

**Corporate Financing Rule:**

- FINRA Corporate Financing Rule (Regulation 5110) limits the underwriting compensation
- Purpose: prevent excessive spreads

**Key provisions:**

- Filing required if underwriting is >$500,000 in compensation
- Compensation includes: cash, warrants, non-cash compensation
- Maximum underwriting compensation = 8% of gross proceeds
- Items of value received from issuer or affiliates within 180 days of filing may be counted

**Restricted Periods:**

  restricted persons
- Includes:
  - FINRA member firms and their employees
  - Immediate family of above
  - Finders or fiduciaries to the issuer
  - Portfolio managers who purchase IPOs for client accounts

  business
- PROHIBITED under FINRA rules
- Example: Giving hot IPO shares to CEO in hopes of getting future underwriting deals

**Flipping:**

- Flipping: Quickly selling newly purchased IPO shares for profit
- Discourages long-term investment
- Underwriters may penalize customers who flip (withhold future IPO allocations)
- Penalty bid: Reclaiming selling concession from broker whose customer flipped

**Free-riding and Withholding:**

- FREE-RIDING: Withholding shares of a new offering to sell later at higher price
- PROHIBITED
- Broker-dealers must make bona fide public distribution

**Conflicts of Interest - General Relationship:**

- FINRA Rule 5121 covers conflicts of interest in underwriting
- When member firm has conflict of interest, additional protections required

**Conflicts exist when:**

- 10% or more of net proceeds go to a FINRA member
- FINRA member will use proceeds to pay debt to another member
- Firm is issuing its own securities

**For offerings where conflict exists:**

- Qualified independent underwriter (QIU) required
- QIU performs due diligence and prices the offering independently
- Discretionary accounts cannot purchase without prior written approval

**Regulation M:**

- SEC Regulation M prohibits manipulation during offerings
- Prohibits underwriter/issuer from bidding for or purchasing securities during offering

**Cooling Off Period (Regulation M):**

- For actively traded securities: 1 business day
- For less actively traded: 5 business days
- Stabilizing bid permitted (see below)

**Stabilization:**

- EXCEPTION to manipulation rules
- Managing underwriter may place stabilizing bid to prevent/slow price decline during distribution
- Must be AT or BELOW public offering price
- Disclosed in prospectus

**Penalty Bids:**
