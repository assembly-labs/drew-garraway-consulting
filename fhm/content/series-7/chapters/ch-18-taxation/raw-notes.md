## Section 1: Tax Basics and Taxation of Equity

### Introduction

- Investing in securities often involves taxes
- Type of taxes depends on: kind of security purchased, type and amount of income received, length
  of time the security was held
- Equity → may receive taxable dividends
- Profit from buying/selling option or equity → capital gain
- Tax laws written by Congress, enforced by the IRS

### Topic 1: Tax Basics

#### Internal Revenue Service

- The IRS is part of the Department of the Treasury
- Responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing the Internal Revenue Code
- The IRS also helps in enforcing the tax code by publishing Revenue Rulings
- If items cannot be found, IRS rules and procedures can be found
- This is the Department of Justice that enforces the revenue code

#### Tax Filing Tip

- While the IRS collects taxes and enforces tax codes, it does not prosecute tax evaders — that's
  the Department of Justice

#### Types of Income

- Income broken into 3 categories:
  1. **Earned income** — salaries, wages, bonuses, tips, commissions, self-employment income;
     subject to FICA taxes
  2. **Portfolio (investment) income** — dividends, interest, capital gains; NOT subject to FICA
  3. **Passive income** — rental income, limited partnership income; can only be used to offset
     passive losses

#### Capital Gains and Losses

- If an investor sells at a profit, that profit is considered to be a capital gain
- Capital gains can be short-term or long-term depending on holding period
- **Short-term**: held 12 months or less → taxed as ordinary income
- **Long-term**: held MORE than 12 months → taxed at preferential capital gains rate (currently 0%,
  15%, or 20%, depending on income)

| Holding Period of Asset | Maximum Tax Rate                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Short-term (≤12 months) | Ordinary income rate                |
| Long-term (>12 months)  | 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income |

- Short-term capital gains can offset short-term capital losses
- Long-term capital gains can offset long-term capital losses
- If net capital loss exceeds gains, the net capital loss may be used to offset up to $3,000 of
  ordinary income per year
- Excess capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely

#### Tax Filing Tip

- Profits from short sales are always short-term capital gains regardless of holding period
- If individual has excess gains over losses, the net capital gain may be used to reduce ordinary
  income, up to $3,000/year carried forward to future years

#### Determining Cost (Tax) Basis

- Cost basis = purchase price + commission (total amount invested)
- **Share identification**: allows the investor to select which specific shares to sell (must
  instruct broker at time of sale)
- **FIFO**: if investor doesn't specify, IRS default — first shares purchased are first shares sold
- **Average cost**: applicable to mutual fund shares only

#### Tax Basis for a Stock Split

- In a stock split, the number of shares increases and the price per share decreases proportionally
- Example: 100 shares at $100 each = $10,000 cost basis. After 2-for-1 split: 200 shares, cost basis
  per share = $50
- When a company declares a reverse stock split, the number of shares is reduced
  - Example: 100 shares at $25 each, 1-for-5 reverse split = 20 shares at $125 each
- In all cases, the TOTAL cost basis remains the same. The per-share basis changes.

#### No Capital Events in Retirement Plans or Accounts

- Retirement plans (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.) are tax-deferred
- The after-tax contribution of Roth contributions would not be considered a capital event
- Contributions to nonqualified plans are required to follow standard tax rules

### Topic 2: Taxation of Dividends

#### Cash Dividends

- Can be either qualified or nonqualified
- **Qualified dividends** — taxed at investor's capital gains rate (0%, 15%, or 20%)
- **Nonqualified dividends** — taxed at taxpayer's ordinary income rate
- Cash dividends from corporate stock (common and preferred) currently taxed at 15%
- If individual is in highest tax bracket, rate increases to 20%
- Lower rates do NOT apply to interest from corporate bonds — those are taxed as ordinary income

#### Corporations Receive a Tax Benefit on Dividends

- Corporations get a tax break on cash dividends received from other corporations
- 50% or more dividends-received deduction for qualifying dividends
- This is the **dividends-received deduction**

#### Form 1099-DIV

- Portfolio income reported to IRS by the payer on Form 1099-DIV or 1099-INT
- Form 1099-DIV details: cash dividends paid, dividends that qualify for lower tax rates, capital
  gains distributions from investment companies, and REIT distributions
- Interest paid by bond issuers reported on Form 1099-INT (broken into taxable and
  nontaxable/municipal interest)

#### Taxation of Stock Dividends

- **Stock splits** and **stock dividends** are NOT generally taxable when received
- The transaction does not result in a capital gain or loss
- Does not need to be reported on tax return
- A stock dividend requires a change in **per-share cost basis**
- Example: 100 shares at $10/share = $1,000 cost basis. Company issues 10% stock dividend. Now owns
  110 shares. Total cost basis still $1,000. Per-share cost basis = $1,000 / 110 = $9.09

#### Mergers and Convertible Shares

- When a company merges with another, shareholders receive stock in new company for old shares —
  generally NOT a taxable event
- Cost basis = amount paid for original shares
- Conversion of convertible preferred stock (or bonds) to common stock is NOT a taxable event

## Section 2: Taxation of Options

### Topic 1: Taxation of Options

Three possible outcomes for a basic option position:

1. The option **expires** — worthless
2. The position is **closed out** (traded)
3. The option is **exercised**

Each has different tax consequences.

#### Expiration

- If option expires, the taxable gain or loss is simple
- If a **long** position expires, the premium is a **capital loss**
- If a **short** position expires, the premium is a **capital gain**
- Most options expire within a year → considered short-term gains or losses

#### Closeout

- If position is closed out, treated the same as a stock trade
- For option buyer: difference between opening purchase price and closing sale price → capital gain
  or loss
- For option writer (seller): first sells, then profit or loss is the difference between the opening
  sale and subsequent closing purchase

#### Exercise or Assignment

- If option is exercised, there is no immediate tax consequence
- If exercise results in the owner buying stock (exercising a long call or short put), they
  establish a cost basis equal to the breakeven point on the original options trade
- If exercise results in the owner selling stock (short call or long put), the owner will have sales
  proceeds equal to the breakeven on the original option trade

**Capital Gains and Losses From Options Table:**

| Type of Option | If Closed Out (Traded)                      | If Option Expires (Unexercised) | If Option Is Exercised                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Long call      | gain/loss = premium received − premium paid | loss = premium                  | gain/loss = sale price − cost basis (cost basis = strike + premium)              |
| Long put       | gain/loss = premium received − premium paid | loss = premium                  | gain/loss = strike price − premium − cost basis; cost basis = cost of underlying |
| Short call     | gain/loss = premium received − premium paid | gain = premium                  | gain/loss = strike price + premium − cost basis; cost basis = cost of underlying |
| Short put      | gain/loss = premium received − premium paid | gain = premium                  | gain/loss = sale price − cost basis (cost basis = strike price − premium)        |

#### Purchase of a Put on a Stock Held Short Term — Holding Period Is Wiped Out ("0")

- If a put is bought when the underlying stock has been held short-term, the holding period of the
  stock stops counting and reverts to "0"
- If the put is exercised, the holding period is considered to be "0," so any gain is treated as
  short-term
- If put expires, the holding period starts counting again from "0" on the date of expiration

#### Married Put

- If a customer buys stock and buys a put on that stock on the same day, the IRS considers this a
  "bona fide" hedge position
- The intent was not to lock in a short-term gain and stretch it to long-term by buying a put
  against an appreciated stock position
- The put premium is considered to be part of the stock's cost basis (similar to a commission paid)
- The holding period is based on the stock position

---

## Section 3: Taxation of Bonds

### Topic 1: Taxation of Corporate and U.S. Government Debt

- Interest received from corporate bonds is taxed as ordinary income at federal, state, and local
  levels
- Bond interest paid is deductible against a corporation's corporate taxes (unlike dividends paid)
- This is a powerful advantage for corporations choosing to raise capital by issuing debt
- Interest from **Treasury securities** is subject to **federal** taxation but **exempt from state
  and local** taxes
- Interest from money market mutual funds (MMFs) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) is
  taxable at federal, state, and local levels
- All 3 types of securities are subject to potential capital gains taxation if sold at a profit

#### Test-Taking Tip

- Interest from HH/EE bonds and CMOs issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is taxable at
  federal, state, and local levels, even if they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
  government. These are sometimes called **agency securities**.

#### Secondary Market Premiums and Discounts

- A corporate bond, Treasury security, or agency security may be purchased on the secondary market
  at a price other than its par value
- Buyer who pays more than par value → paying a **premium**. The principal repaid at maturity is
  less than what the buyer paid, so the buyer will eventually experience a capital loss — unless
  they amortize
- Buyer who pays less than par → buying at a **discount**. Buyer will eventually experience a
  capital gain unless they sell the bond at or below purchase price

#### Premium Bonds

- If a bond is purchased at a premium, the bondholder has two alternatives to choose from:
  1. **Amortize** the premium: reduce the adjusted cost basis of the bond until, at maturity, the
     adjusted cost basis equals the bond's redemption value. If investor holds to maturity, they
     will have no capital loss.
  2. **Do not amortize**: the annual amortized amount can be used to offset taxable interest income

- Example: Jane purchases a $1,000 10-year bond on the secondary market for $1,100. Bond is
  redeemable in 7 years at par. Premium = $100. Annual amortization = $100/7 ≈ $14.29/year

#### Discount Bonds

- When a bond is bought in the secondary market at a discount, the bondholder again has two
  alternatives
- The gain on the discount can be based when the bond matures or is sold, or it can be spread out
  over the life of the bond, with a portion of the discount being taxed annually
- While a premium is **amortized** (subtracted from cost basis), a discount is **accreted** (added
  to cost basis)
- The IRS says that an accreted discount is taxable as ordinary income
- First step is to determine the **adjusted cost basis**: purchase price plus the amount of accreted
  discount
- Then the sales price is subtracted from the adjusted cost basis to determine any gain or loss

#### Net Yield and Taxable Equivalent Yield

**Bond Interest Taxation Table:**

| Bond Type | Federally Taxable? | State and Local Taxable?                  |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Municipal | Exempt             | Depends on residency and source of income |
| Treasury  | Taxable            | Exempt                                    |
| Corporate | Taxable            | Taxable                                   |

**Net Yield Formula:**

- coupon rate × (1 − tax rate)

**Net Yield Example:**

- Customer with combined tax bracket of 30% considering a 10% corporate bond
- Net yield = 10% × (1 − .30) = 10% × .70 = 7% net yield
- Therefore, a 10% corporate bond is equivalent to a 7% tax-free municipal bond

**Taxable Equivalent Yield Formula:**

- coupon rate ÷ (1 − tax rate)

**Taxable Equivalent Yield Example:**

- Customer considering buying a 6% municipal bond, combined tax bracket of 25%
- Taxable equivalent yield = 6% ÷ (1 − .25) = 6% ÷ .75 = 8%
- Therefore, a 6% municipal bond is equivalent to a comparable 8% taxable corporate bond

### Topic 2: Taxation of Municipal Securities

#### Municipal Bond Interest

- One reason an investor may choose to purchase municipal bonds is that their interest is taxed at a
  lower rate than corporate bonds
- For Treasury bond interest, an investor pays federal taxes but no state taxes
- For municipal bonds, the tax benefits can be even greater — investors pay no federal taxes on
  interest from municipal bonds, and they also pay no state or municipal taxes if they live in the
  state or municipality that issued the bond
- Interest from munis issued by U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands) is exempt
  from federal, state, and local income taxes — **"triple-tax-exempt"** bonds

#### Municipal Bonds Purchased in the Secondary Market

- Must **amortize** premium — no capital loss if bond is held to maturity
- The amortized amount will reduce the bond's cost basis
- If bond is held to maturity, there will be no capital loss reported
- Since municipal bonds pay tax-exempt interest, a bond trading at a premium will have a higher
  coupon; the investor should not be able to claim a loss based on the premium paid

#### Original Issue Discount (OID) Municipal Bonds

- Rules for computing holding periods and cost basis for zero-coupon municipal bonds (also called
  original issue discount bonds) are generally the same, with some important exceptions
- For new-issue zero-coupon municipal bonds, the discount must be accreted over the life of the bond
- The annual accretion amount is considered to be non-taxable municipal interest income
- Every year, the bond's cost basis for tax purposes is increased by the accretion amount
- If held to maturity, adjusted basis = par, so there is no capital gain or loss

#### Bank Qualified Bonds

- Banks can deduct 80% of their carrying costs (interest paid on deposits) if the money is invested
  in **bank qualified municipal bonds**
- These are defined as public interest bonds, whose issuer offers no more than $10 million of
  tax-exempt bonds during a single calendar year
- This allows issuers of bank qualified bonds to offer them at slightly lower interest rates

## Section 4: Taxation of Mutual Funds

### Topic 1: Taxation of Mutual Funds

#### Regulated Fund Must Distribute 90% of Net Investment Income

- Subchapter M of the tax code: if a regulated investment company (RIC) distributes at least 90% of
  its net investment income to shareholders, the fund is not taxed on distributed earnings/income
- Shareholders then include those earnings on their personal tax returns

#### Capital Gains Distributed Once Per Year; Losses Are Not Distributed

- If a fund sells off appreciated securities, it will have a capital gain — if it sells off
  depreciated securities, it will have a capital loss
- Net gains ARE distributed to shareholders as capital gains distributions
- Net losses are NOT distributed; they are retained in the fund
- Mutual fund investors are taxed based on three events:
  1. The fund distributes dividends — from dividends and interest received by the fund
  2. The fund distributes capital gains — from profits earned on sale of stocks/bonds in the fund
  3. The investor sells (redeems) shares

#### Fund Distributions

- Dividends are taxed at either the qualified rate or the investor's ordinary income rate
- Capital gains distributions are based on the short-term capital gains rate if fund held the
  security for 1 year or less
- Capital gains distributions are based on long-term capital gains rate if the fund held the
  securities for more than 1 year
- Note: fund capital gains distributions are determined to be long or short based on the fund's
  holding period, with the investor's
- Capital losses are not distributed to shareholders
- Note: fund capital gains distributions are determined to be long or short based on the fund's
  holding period (not the investor's)
- Capital losses are not distributed to shareholders
- Unrealized gains are not taxable

#### Types of Bond Funds

- Tax-advantaged funds are suitable for investors with high tax rates

**Taxation of Bond Fund Dividends:**

| Type of Fund                | Taxable at this level: |         |         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- | ------- |
|                             | Federal                | State   | Local   |
| Corporate bond funds        | Yes                    | Yes     | Yes     |
| Agency (GNMA and CMO) funds | Yes                    | Yes     | Yes     |
| Treasury funds              | Yes                    | No      | No      |
| Municipal bond funds        | No                     | Maybe\* | Maybe\* |

\*Municipal bonds from other states may be subject to state and local taxes

#### Capital Gains or Losses on the Sale of Mutual Fund Shares

- Sale of mutual fund shares is taxed as a capital gain or loss
- Exchanging shares between different funds within a fund family is considered a taxable event
- Mutual fund investors may use an average cost method to determine the cost basis: cost basis =
  total investment / number of shares

#### Capital Gains Tax

- If an investor sells or exchanges mutual fund shares for a profit, they must pay a tax on the gain
- Shares held for 1 year or less → short-term capital gains and taxed as ordinary income
- Held for more than 1 year → long-term capital gains rate would apply
- Investors not required to pay capital gains taxes when they sell shares of the mutual fund at a
  loss

#### Cost Basis of Mutual Fund Shares

- When calculating cost basis, the original cost of the shares needs to be adjusted (increased to
  account for reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions)
- Methods: FIFO (default), average cost, specific identification
- Also takes charges, commissions, and fees into account
- Fund fees that cannot be added to the cost basis: front-end sales charges are dividends and
  capital gains distributions, which, in mutual funds, are generally reinvested in the fund

#### Automatic Reinvestment

- Investors may receive dividends and capital gains in the form of cash, or they may automatically
  reinvest in more shares
- Automatic reinvestment occurs at the NAV and does not incur sales charges
- Even though reinvested, the dividends and capital gains are subject to taxation
- Reinvested dividends: must pay tax on distributions received, even if reinvested
- Fund pays out distributions; investor uses that money to buy more shares at NAV

#### Switching Funds

- Switching within a fund family is a taxable event — the sale generates a capital gain or loss and
  the purchase creates a new position
- Don't confuse this with switching between funds in a 401(k) — the 401(k) shelters from immediate
  taxation

#### Fund Distributions

- Mutual funds generally pay out a combination of: capital gains, interest income, and dividend
  income each year
- Investors pay short-term capital gains taxes on securities sold by the fund that were held for 1
  year or less
- Capital gains occurring within a fund which it sells previously-held securities are passed on to
  shareholders
- For fund capital gains, if a firm holds underlying assets for 1 year or more → long-term for the
  shareholders
- Funds never distribute net capital losses — they're reflected in the fund's NAV
- The dividends paid by a municipal bond fund may represent tax-free income, but profits made by the
  fund buying and selling bonds are taxable capital gains to the shareholders
- The price of a fund may decline, but unitholders may still be subject to capital gains if the fund
  sells securities within the fund at a profit

## Section 5: Taxation of Annuities, Life Insurance, and Retirement Plans

### Topic 1: Taxation of Annuities, Life Insurance, and Retirement Plans

#### Taxation of Annuities

- Annuity contributions during the accumulation phase of a nonqualified annuity are made with
  **after-tax dollars**
- Earnings grow **tax-deferred** inside the annuity

#### Random Withdrawal

- During accumulation phase, any withdrawal is subject to taxation
- The IRS considers withdrawals during accumulation as coming first from **earnings** (taxable) then
  from **principal** (not taxable) — this is the **LIFO** method
- Penalty: 10% additional tax on withdrawals before age 59½

#### Taxation of Death Benefit

- If the annuity owner dies during the accumulation phase, beneficiary pays ordinary income tax on
  the gain (amount above cost basis)

#### 1035 Exchange — Section 1035 Tax-Free Exchange

- Allows exchange of one annuity for another without triggering a taxable event
- Can also exchange life insurance for annuity (but NOT annuity for life insurance)
- The exchange must be a direct transfer

#### Exchange of Annuity for Life Insurance Contract is Taxable

- Cannot do a 1035 exchange from an annuity to a life insurance contract
- That would be a taxable event

#### Annuitization Phase

- When the annuity is annuitized, each payment consists of two parts:
  1. Return of cost basis (not taxable)
  2. Earnings portion (taxable as ordinary income)
- **Exclusion ratio** determines the non-taxable portion of each payment

#### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

- Non-qualified annuity: no RMDs during owner's lifetime (but beneficiary rules apply)

#### Losses During the Accumulation Phase

- If the annuity value drops below the cost basis and the contract is surrendered, the loss may be
  deductible

#### Tax-Qualified Variable Annuities

- Contributions to qualified variable annuities are made with **pre-tax dollars**
- All distributions are taxable as ordinary income (because contributions were never taxed)

#### Taxation of Life Insurance Products

- Cash value buildup inside a life insurance policy: **tax-deferred**
- Death benefit: generally **tax-free** to the beneficiary

#### Taxation of Loans and Death Benefit

- Policy loans are not taxable events
- If the policy lapses with an outstanding loan, the loan amount may become taxable

#### Taxation of Work-Sponsored Retirement Plans

- Tax-qualified plans: contributions are tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred
- Distributions are taxed as ordinary income

#### Traditional IRAs

- Contributions: **Tax-deductible** (if eligible — depends on income and whether covered by employer
  plan)
- Earnings: **Tax-deferred** (grow without taxation until distribution)
- Distributions: **Taxed as ordinary income**
- Early withdrawal (before 59½): 10% penalty + ordinary income tax
- Required Minimum Distributions: must begin by April 1 of the year following the year you turn 73

**Traditional IRA Flow:** Pre-Tax Contributions → Tax-Deferred Growth → Taxable Distributions

**Traditional IRA (If Funded with Pre-Tax Contributions):** Pre-Tax Contributions → Tax-Deferred
Growth → Tax-Free Distributions on contributions / Taxable on earnings

#### Roth IRAs

- Contributions: Made with **after-tax dollars** (NOT tax-deductible)
- Earnings: **Tax-free** growth
- Qualified distributions: **Tax-free** (if account is at least 5 years old and owner is 59½ or
  older)
- No Required Minimum Distributions during owner's lifetime
- Early withdrawal of contributions: always tax-free (they were already taxed)
- Early withdrawal of earnings: may be subject to tax and 10% penalty

**Roth IRA Flow:** Post-Tax Contributions → Tax-Free Growth → Tax-Free Distributions

#### IRA Rollovers and Transfers

- When rolling over from one IRA to another, must complete within 60 days
- Can only do one rollover per 12-month period
- Direct trustee-to-trustee transfers: unlimited, no tax consequence

#### Traditional IRA Conversion to Roth

- Taxable event — must pay ordinary income tax on the amount converted (since traditional IRA was
  funded with pre-tax dollars)
- No 10% early withdrawal penalty on conversions
- No income limits on conversions

---

## Section 6: Taxation of REITs and DPPs

### Topic 1: Taxation of REITs and DPPs

#### Tax Treatment of REITs

- A REIT must pay out at least 90% of its net investment income to shareholders (like a regulated
  investment company)
- REIT distributions are generally taxed as ordinary income (not qualified dividend rate)
- If the REIT passes Subchapter M: the REIT itself is not taxed on distributed income
- REITs are pass-through entities for tax purposes
- **Sub-Chapter M**: REIT must distribute 90% of net investment income to avoid being taxed at
  corporate level

#### Taxation of Income from DPPs/Limited Partnerships

- DPPs are organized as limited partnerships → **pass-through** taxation
- The partnership itself does not pay taxes; income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits flow
  through to the individual partners
- Partners report their share on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)

#### Tax Treatment of DPPs

##### Passive Income (and Loss)

- Income from limited partnerships is classified as **passive income**
- Passive losses can ONLY offset passive income (not earned income or portfolio income)
- Exception: $25,000 allowance for active participation in real estate rental activities

##### Tax Credit vs. Tax Deduction

- **Tax deduction**: reduces taxable income; the actual tax savings depends on the investor's tax
  bracket
- **Tax credit**: reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar; more valuable than a deduction

##### Investor Basis in the Partnership

- **Tax basis** = investor's total allowable deductions from the partnership. This is the limit of
  loss deductions.
- Tax basis starts at the amount of the initial investment
- Basis includes:
  - Cash contributions
  - Recourse debt (investor personally liable)
  - Share of partnership income
- Basis is reduced by: distributions, losses, nonrecourse debt reductions

##### Items That Establish the Basis

- Cash contributions
- Additional capital contributions made by the investor
- Investor's proportionate share of partnership recourse debt
- Investor's proportionate share of the partnership's undistributed income
- Nonrecourse debt (for real estate partnerships only)

##### Items That Increase the Basis

- Additional contributions
- Increase in partner's share of partnership liabilities
- Investor's proportionate share of partnership income

##### Items That Reduce the Basis

- Distributions to the partner
- Losses allocated to partner
- Decrease in partner's share of liabilities (e.g., debt repayments)

##### Items That Establish the Basis

- At tax loss greater than the basis → cannot deduct additional losses; excess losses are suspended
  and carried forward

##### Basic Deductions: Depreciation Limit Each Year

- Most real estate or equipment leasing partnerships generate deductions primarily through
  depreciation
- Example: Limited partnership with a building acquired at $2,500,000. Generating depreciation
  produces annual deductions. The partnership takes $2,500,000 / 27.5 years for residential property

##### Can Only Deduct Passive Losses Against Other Passive Income

- Calculating the investor's profit/loss: the investor has investment of $50,000 in a limited
  partnership
- Passive losses can only offset passive income
- If a partner has excess passive losses: carry forward to future years (use against future passive
  income)

##### Disposing of a Partnership

- Disposition of a partnership entity: investor basis as zero
- When an investor disposes of the partnership interest, the investor sold their partnership unit,
  plus any suspended passive losses become deductible at that point

#### Leveraged Leases: Limited or Non-Recourse

- Limited partners are limited to recourse debt as partnership basis
- At-risk rules limit loss deductions to recourse debt only for most partnerships
- Exception: Real estate partnerships can include nonrecourse debt in basis

---

## Section 7: Other Tax Issues

### Topic 1: Other Tax Issues

#### Charitable Donations of Securities

- When an individual decides to donate securities to a qualified charity, the donor can deduct the
  fair market value (FMV) of the securities as of the date of donation from their taxable income for
  that year as long as the securities have been held long-term (more than a year)
- If held short-term: can only deduct the cost of the securities (not the FMV)

#### Estate Tax and Stepped-Up Tax Basis on Inherited Securities

- When a person dies, their estate may be subject to estate taxes
- A person who inherits assets from an estate is not subject to estate taxes
- When inherited: the FMV when the deceased person died is the new cost basis for the securities
- This is the **stepped-up cost basis** (or stepped-down if value decreased)
- Capital gains and losses from selling inherited securities are always **long-term** regardless of
  actual holding period

#### Gift Shares — Gift Tax

- Gift taxes are different from regular income taxes — only affect the wealthy
- Gifts up to $18,000 per person per year (2024) are excluded from gift tax
- A married couple can double that exclusion ($36,000)

#### Tax Basis of Gifted Securities

- Gift taxes are taxable to the donor (recipient does NOT pay gift tax)
- If a gift is NOT taxed: recipient's cost basis is the lower of either the giver's cost basis or
  the fair market value at the time of the gift
- Recipient will also use the giver's holding period

**Rules for gifted securities:**

- If given to a qualified charity: the donor can deduct the FMV of the securities at the time of the
  gift as a charitable donation, as long as the donor has held the securities for at least 12 months
- If the securities have been held less than a year, the donor can only deduct the cost of the
  securities rather than the fair market value

#### Wash Sale Rules

- When an investor sells securities at a loss and then buys back the same or substantially identical
  securities within **30 days** (before or after), the loss cannot be used for tax purposes
- This is considered a **wash sale** (IRS disallows the loss)
- The wash sale period covers: 61 days — 30 days before the trade and 30 days after the trade, plus
  the day of the trade
- Example: Customer sells 300 shares of XYZ. They have realized a loss of $1,200 on the shares. Two
  weeks later, they change their minds and buy back 300 shares of XYZ at $21 per share. This would
  be considered a wash sale, and the loss is not deductible.
- A wash sale is not illegal; it simply can't be treated as a loss
- The wash sale rule also applies to IRAs and taxable accounts
- The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement securities

#### Municipal Bond Tax Swap

- Based on the wash sale rule, if the same security is sold at a loss and then bought back it's a
  wash sale
- BUT: a "similar" (not "substantially identical") security is bought — the wash sale rule DOES NOT
  apply
- Investor trades one municipal bond for another (different issuer, maturity, coupon) to realize a
  tax loss

#### Annual Gift Tax Exclusion and Lifetime Gift Tax Exclusion

- Gifts made from individuals to other individuals are subject to a limit paid by the giver
- Annual exclusion: an individual may transfer amounts to any number of individuals free of gift tax
  up to the limit
- Lifetime exclusion: the unified estate/lifetime exemption is $13.61 million (2024)
- The annual exclusion and the lifetime exclusion are separate
- After an individual's annual exclusion is used up, additional amounts count toward the lifetime
  exclusion
- Contributions of $18,000 or less are considered gifts to the account's beneficiary for purposes of
  gift tax
- But AGI amounts in excess of $18,000 are prorated

| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Annual Gift Tax   | $18,000        | $19,000        | $19,000        |
| Lifetime Gift Tax | $13.61 Million | $13.99 Million | $13.99 million |

#### Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

- An alternative way of calculating income taxes
- Was created as a backstop to make sure wealthy taxpayers could not avoid paying any income tax at
  all
- The AMT is often called a "parallel" tax system — it is not truly an alternative or optional way
  of calculating income taxes
- Instead: taxpayers are required to calculate their alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) and
  pay the tax on this amount if it is greater than what they owe under regular income tax
  calculation
- However, most Americans do not have to worry about the AMT since it primarily hits higher-income
  taxpayers
- For the very highest earners, however, the AMT is less of an issue — they pay marginal federal
  income tax rates higher than the maximum AMT rates

**AMT vs. regular income tax differences:**

- Municipal bonds are a key difference: interest from **private activity bonds** is added back to
  income for AMT purposes
- State and local taxes are not deductible at all for AMT, as opposed to being deductible up to
  $10,000 for regular income tax
- Home mortgage interest is only deductible if the home equity loan is used to purchase or improve a
  primary or secondary residence (not if the funds are used for something else)
- Profits on exercising incentive stock options (to acquire and not immediately sell): employee
  stock options are not taxable as you sell them — under the AMT, the difference between the grant
  price of an incentive stock option and the fair market value at the time of exercise is included
  as income
- Accelerated depreciation may need to be adjusted: straight-line depreciation is not affected
- If the exam asks you to identify which investment choice would help an investor reduce or avoid
  AMT exposure, you would want to pick anything that doesn't **adjust gross income (AGI)**: the
  lower your AGI, the lower your AMT. Contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as
  401(k)s, 403(b)s, 457(b)s, and SIMPLEs, IRA plans, as well as medical deductible HSAs and health
  savings accounts — all reduce AGI and therefore reduce AMT
