## Section 1: Characteristics of Municipal Debt

In 1975, New York City was about to become the first major American city to default. The city's
finances were so dire that it couldn't pay its bills, and no bank would lend it money. President
Ford initially refused federal assistance, leading to the famous New York Daily News headline: "Ford
to City: Drop Dead." Eventually, the state stepped in with emergency loans—but the lesson was clear:
municipal bonds are not risk-free.

### Why This Section Matters

Municipal bonds offer unique tax advantages that make them attractive to investors in high tax
brackets. Understanding how they're issued, taxed, and structured—including the critical difference
between general obligation and revenue bonds—is essential for the Series 7 exam.

---

### Topic 1: Municipal Debt Basic Characteristics

Municipal securities are exempt from federal regulations. However, a self-regulatory body, the
<span class="key-term">Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)</span>, regulates broker-dealers
and advisers who deal in municipal securities, but it has no authority over municipal issuers, which
are self-governing.

Because municipal securities are exempt from registration, issuers do not have to publish a
prospectus, which is a detailed disclosure document. Instead, they offer a less detailed disclosure
document called an <span class="key-term">official statement</span>. This document contains
information about the bonds and the financial condition of the issuer.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Municipal Bond Maturities</div>
  <p><span class="key-term">Municipal debt maturities</span> can be either long-term debt or short-term notes. Most long-term issues are serial bonds with maturities spread over a sequence of years. These bonds are issued at par and pay interest semiannually.</p>
  <p>Short-term notes can be issued in two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At a discount to par, which matures at par value</li>
    <li>At par, which matures at par plus accrued interest</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Characteristics of Municipal Bonds

- Interest income not taxed at the federal level
- Exempt from registration, but not from anti-fraud requirements
- Come with an official statement instead of a prospectus
- Good for investors in higher tax brackets
- Typically less risky than corporate bonds
- Good for portfolio diversification

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Municipal Bond Ratings</div>
  <p>Unlike U.S. Treasury securities, which are not subject to default risk, municipal debt is not risk-free. Municipal bonds are often rated by Moody's or Standard & Poor's (S&P) using the same scale as corporate bonds. Bonds that are unrated typically have higher risk.</p>
  <p>Bonds that are insured will automatically be rated AAA. This is because the credit rating is that of the insurance company that backs them, not the issuer. This may be referred to as <span class="key-term">credit enhancement</span>.</p>
</div>

Municipal bond insurers include:

- American Municipal Bond Assurance Corporation (Ambac)
- Municipal Bond Insurance Association (MBIA)
- Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC)

#### Municipal Debt Tax Status

A major advantage of investing in municipal bonds is that the interest income received is
<span class="key-term">exempt</span> from federal income tax. For most issues, if the purchaser is a
resident of the state of issuance, state and local governments will also exempt these issues from
taxation. If a bond's interest is exempt at the local, state, and federal levels, it is said to be
<span class="key-term">triple tax-exempt</span>.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Issues of territories or possessions of the U.S. (Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands) are always triple tax-exempt, no matter where the purchaser resides.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Because municipal bonds are often triple tax-free, they are often a good choice (suitable) for investors in high tax brackets.</p>

### Topic 2: Retiring Municipal Debt—Types of Calls

<span class="key-term">Optional calls</span> allow the issuer to call a bond, in whole or in part,
at its discretion for any reason. Optional calls are typically made when the issuer can reissue the
debt at a lower interest rate.

<span class="key-term">Extraordinary calls</span> (also called <span class="key-term">catastrophe
calls</span>) allow the issuer to redeem bonds if certain events occur, such as an earthquake or a
fire. These calls may be optional or <span class="key-term">mandatory</span>.

<span class="key-term">Mandatory calls</span> or <span class="key-term">sinking fund
redemption</span> require the issuer to set aside periodic payments aimed at
<span class="key-term">amortizing</span>, or reducing, its debt. Funds are periodically placed in
<span class="key-term">escrow</span> to provide for the future retirement of the issuer's long-term
debt before maturity. The trustee managing the escrow account must invest the money in safe and
liquid securities.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Types of Calls</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In-whole calls:</strong> The entire issue is retired</li>
    <li><strong>Partial calls:</strong> Only part of the issue is retired; notification letter sent at least 30 days in advance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For serial bonds, the later maturities may be called first if they have higher interest rates than the earlier maturities, depending on relative call dates.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Yield to Worst:</strong> When a bond is subject to an in-whole call, the yield provided to a customer must be the lower of the yield to call or yield to maturity. This is referred to as the <span class="key-term">yield to worst</span>. Partial calls, catastrophe calls, and sinking fund calls are not covered by this requirement.</p>
</div>

## Section 2: Types of Municipal Debt

### Topic 1: General Obligation (GO) Bonds

A <span class="key-term">general obligation bond (GO bond)</span> is backed by the full faith,
credit, and taxing power of the issuer. GO bonds are typically backed by tax revenue. This means
that GO bonds typically rely on voter approval to be issued.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Types of Taxes Backing GO Bonds</div>
  <p>The type of tax that backs GO bonds depends on the issuing entity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>State GO bonds:</strong> Usually paid with income, sales, and excise taxes collected at the state level</li>
    <li><strong>Local GO bonds:</strong> Most commonly backed by <span class="key-term">ad valorem</span> property taxes (non-tax revenue such as parking fees, park and recreation fees, and licensing fees may be applied as well)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">What Is Ad Valorem?</div>
  <p>An <span class="key-term">ad valorem</span> tax (Latin for "according to value") is a tax based on the price or value of a product. Income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes are all ad valorem taxes. If a Series 7 exam question mentions ad valorem taxes, you can assume it's talking about property taxes. The amount owed by the property owner is typically based on a mill rate (sometimes called millage) that gives the rate of taxes per $1,000 of assessed value.</p>
</div>

#### Debt Limits and Tax Levies

In some cases, issuers will sell <span class="key-term">limited tax bonds</span>. This means that a
limit is placed on the rate at which the issuer is allowed to assess. The bondholders would be at
risk if the issuer is not collecting enough taxes to service the debt. As a result, limited tax
bonds have more credit risk than unlimited tax bonds and sell at higher interest rates.

Many municipalities also have imposed a <span class="key-term">statutory debt limit</span> on the
dollar amount of GO bonds that can be outstanding at any one time. A municipality cannot issue
additional GO bonds if it is already at its debt limit.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Analyzing GO Bonds</div>
  <p>When analyzing a GO bond, consider the overall financial health of the issuing municipality. Signs of a healthy economy include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High and growing property values</li>
    <li>A diversified economy including many different employers</li>
    <li>High income levels</li>
    <li>The ability to increase taxes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Key debt metrics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Net direct debt:</strong> Short- and long-term general obligation debt, less cash and cash equivalents</li>
    <li><strong>Overlapping debt:</strong> Debt issued by municipalities that have overlapping geographic boundaries</li>
    <li><strong>Net overall debt per capita:</strong> Measure of total tax burden on a municipality's residents</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Capital Appreciation Bonds (CABs)

<span class="key-term">Capital appreciation bonds (CABs)</span> are municipal zero-coupon bonds with
a legal twist. CABs are usually sold at a deep discount to par, and only the discounted principal
amount is counted against the issuer's debt limit. For this reason, CABs are good for municipalities
that are close to their debt limit.

---

### Topic 2: Revenue Bonds

A <span class="key-term">revenue bond</span> is backed by revenue from a specific source, such as a
public hospital, a toll bridge, or a sports arena. Revenue bonds are not backed by the full faith
and credit of the issuer and are often issued by a separate authority, such as a transportation
authority. Unlike GO bonds, revenue bonds do not allow the bondholders to force taxation or
legislative action for payment.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">GO Bonds vs. Revenue Bonds</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>GO Bonds</th>
      <th>Revenue Bonds</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Backing</td>
      <td>Full faith and credit (taxes)</td>
      <td>Revenues from specific project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purpose</td>
      <td>Fund municipality's budget</td>
      <td>Fund a specific project</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Debt limits</td>
      <td>Apply</td>
      <td>Do not apply</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Safety</td>
      <td>Typically safer</td>
      <td>Typically riskier</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Revenue bonds are said to be self-supporting debt, as only the specified revenues are used to back
the issue. The types of revenue that back these bonds are revenues from the operation of a specific
project, user fees, rents, grants, excise, and other non-ad valorem taxes. Statutory debt limits do
not apply to revenue bonds.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Many test questions will focus on the differences between GO bonds and revenue bonds. For example, a feasibility study would not be used for a GO bond, and a statutory debt limit would not apply to a revenue bond.</p>
</div>

#### Protective Covenants

Revenue bonds are issued with an indenture that includes protective
<span class="key-term">covenants</span>. Important covenants include:

- **Additional bonds covenant:** New bonds must rely on the same revenue as existing bonds; must not
  create too great a burden on the issuer's revenue stream
- **Insurance covenant:** Requires the issuer to carry enough insurance to protect against damage or
  destruction
- **Operations and maintenance covenant:** Requires the issuer to maintain the facility throughout
  the bond's life
- **Rate covenant:** Requires the issuer to set rates or fees at levels sufficient to cover the
  project's expenses, including debt service (the designated level is known as the
  <span class="key-term">coverage ratio</span>)

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Debt Service Coverage Ratio</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income ÷ Annual Principal and Interest Payments</div>
  <p>A ratio of less than 1 indicates that a project's operating income is insufficient to pay for the issuer's annual principal and income payments. A ratio of 2 or more is generally considered acceptable for an issuer of a revenue bond.</p>
</div>

---

### Topic 3: Other Types of Municipal Debt

#### Special Tax Bonds

<span class="key-term">Special tax bonds</span> are issues secured by a tax other than ad valorem
tax. These bonds are usually secured with excise taxes, such as cigarette, liquor, and gasoline
taxes. This tax source does not have to relate to the type of project. These bonds are generally
considered to be revenue bonds.

#### Double-Barreled Bonds

<span class="key-term">Double-barreled bonds</span> are backed by a revenue source other than ad
valorem taxes, but they are also backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of a municipal
issuer. For example, a highway revenue bond may be backed by toll revenues from the highway and by
the issuing state's taxing power. The combined backing will improve its credit rating. This type of
bond is treated as a GO bond since the ultimate source of payment is taxing power.

#### Parity Bonds

<span class="key-term">Parity bonds</span> have an equal claim to tax collections or revenues as
other outstanding obligations of their issuer.

#### Moral Obligation Bonds

<span class="key-term">Moral obligation bonds</span> are issued on a municipality assuming
responsibility for another issuer's debt. They represent a promise to pay, but they do not represent
the legal obligation to pay.

#### Certificates of Participation (COPs)

<span class="key-term">Certificates of participation (COPs)</span> are backed by lease payments made
by a municipality. These bonds allow a municipality to continue issuing debt even after reaching its
debt limit.

#### Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs)

<span class="key-term">Industrial development bonds (IDBs)</span> are issued by a state, city, or
local agency to build an industrial facility that is to be leased to a private company. The lease
payments of the company are the revenue source that backs the bonds.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The interest on IDBs may be subject to federal and local taxes since these bonds are ultimately used for private purposes.</p>
</div>

#### Build America Bonds (BABs)

<span class="key-term">Build America Bonds (BABs)</span> were issued in response to the Great
Recession of 2008. To help with an economic recovery, municipalities could issue taxable bonds known
as BABs. These bonds got a 35% interest rate credit from the federal government.

#### Construction Loan Notes (CLNs)

<span class="key-term">Construction Loan Notes (CLNs)</span> are issued to fund the building of
multifamily housing projects. The note is paid off by placement of a final long-term bond issue on
the "take out" loan, which replaces the CLN issue.

---

### Topic 4: Money Market Instruments

Short-term debt instruments and those with less than one year to maturity are considered
<span class="key-term">money market</span> debt. The short maturity of these securities makes them
less volatile. They are also very safe with low yields because of this offer.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Instrument</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Treasury bills (T-bills)</strong></td>
      <td>U.S. government-backed securities offered with maturities of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Typically mature within the next year.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Arrangements in which a dealer sells securities to another dealer with an agreement to buy them back later at a fixed yield.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Municipal Notes

Short-term municipal notes are categorized into types. The first type is often referred to as
<span class="key-term">anticipation notes</span>, because they are issued in anticipation of an
expected source of income. The taxes, revenue, or other longer-term bonds. Anticipation notes allow
a project to get underway before more permanent funding has been received.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Types of Anticipation Notes</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bond anticipation notes (BANs):</strong> Issued to start capital projects. The note is paid off by the time a final long-term bond is issued. BANs are used because the ultimate final cost of the project is unknown during the construction period. Most BANs are secured by a general obligation pledge of the issuer.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax anticipation notes (TANs):</strong> Used when future tax income is anticipated, and a municipality wishes to obtain funds before they are collected. TANs are secured by a general obligation pledge of the issuer.</li>
    <li><strong>Revenue anticipation notes (RANs):</strong> Issued in anticipation of future revenues—collections and revenues other than ad valorem taxes—include revenues from licenses, permits, and fees.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs):</strong> Issued in anticipation of both future tax collections and revenue collections.</li>
    <li><strong>Grant anticipation notes (GANs):</strong> Issued in expectation of receiving grant monies.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax-exempt commercial paper:</strong> Issued with very short maturities and is backed by a bank line of credit.</li>
  </ul>
