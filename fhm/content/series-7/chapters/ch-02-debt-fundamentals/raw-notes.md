## Section 1: Bond Basics and Pricing

### Introduction to Bond Basics and Pricing

Bonds are **fixed-income** debt securities which are issued by corporations, the federal government/agencies, and municipal entities. These securities provide income to investors in the form of interest payments.

### Key Concepts

After finishing this section, you should be familiar with the following topics:
- What is a Bond?
- Bond Structure
- Bond Pricing and Quote Spread

### Topic 1: What Is a Bond?

A bond is a fixed-income security that represents a loan to an issuer that needs money (often a corporation or government entity) from an investor who has funds to lend. The issuer promises to pay the lender interest and repay the **principal** of the loan at maturity. Maturity is the date at which the bond will be redeemed.

**Key Relationships:**
- Bond Issuer = Borrower = Debtor
- Bond Investor = Lender = Creditor

#### Bond Certificates

Bonds are debt securities that represent money loaned to an issuer. The bondholders are not equity owners of the business the way stockholders are. Bondholders are creditors who are owed money for a debt. The bond is evidence of the issuer's indebtedness to the investor.

#### Bond Interest

Bonds are issued with a stated face value known as the **par value** (usually $1,000 minimum). Bonds pay interest periodically, typically semiannually or annually. The **coupon rate** (often referred to simply as "coupon") is the annualized rate of interest paid on the face value of the bond. It is typically fixed and may also be referred to as the **stated rate**.

**Example:**
ABC Corporation issues a $1,000 par value bond with a coupon rate of 8%. ABC must pay 8% each year, or $80 ($1,000 × 1,000), to the bondholder while the bond is outstanding. At the bond's maturity, the issuer will make the final semiannual coupon payment and repay the par value of the bond.

At maturity, ABC Corporation redeems the issue at par. That means they must repay the $1,000 principal that was loaned at the time of the bond's issuance. The investor also receives the final coupon payment at maturity. At maturity, an ABC bond investor would receive $1,040 (the par value of $1,000 plus the final $40 coupon payment (remember that coupon payments are made semiannually)).

**Test-Taking Tip:** Each year ABC Corporation will pay interest of $80 on each bond. If not told otherwise, assume the interest is broken into two semiannual payments of $40 each. Be careful during the exam. Sometimes you will be asked how much interest is paid per year, while in other questions you will be asked the amount of the next semiannual interest payment.

#### Bond Certificates Types

Bonds may be issued in paper form. **Bearer bonds**, also called **coupon bonds**, were bond certificates that had no owner's name printed on them and have coupons attached. Anyone who possessed the certificate could present a coupon to receive an interest payment or present the bond itself for payment at maturity. These types of bonds can no longer be issued, although some remain outstanding. Anyone depositing coupons must present identification, and the interest payment is reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

**Registered bonds** are certificates issued to the bondholder with the owner's name printed on them and no coupons attached. Instead, the issuer's **transfer agent** sends the bondholder interest when payments are due and the redeemed principal at maturity. Registered bonds can be transferred to another individual only after the owner endorses the bond. The transfer agent will then cancel the certificate and issue a new one to the new owner.

Registered bonds have largely been replaced by **book-entry bonds**. Owners of a book-entry bond do not receive a physical certificate. Ownership is recorded electronically at a central depository. When the bonds are held in street name, the broker-dealer is listed as the owner rather than their customer. The customer is still a **beneficial owner** and retains all the benefits of ownership, such as transfer rights and interest payments. U.S. government and agency securities are now only issued in book-entry form.

### Topic 2: Bond Structure

#### Term Bonds

A bond issue for which every bond has the same interest rate and maturity is called a term bond issue. Corporate bond issues and U.S. government bond issues are typically term bond issues.

**Example:**
ABC Corporation issues $1,000,000 of 8%, $1,000 par bonds, all maturing in 30 years. Each $1,000 bond within the issue is identical—each bond has the same maturity and the same interest rate.

#### Zero-Coupon Bonds

Bonds can also be issued with a stated par value but with a coupon rate of zero. No interest payments are made on zero-coupon bonds. Instead, the bonds are purchased at a discount from par and are redeemed upon maturity at par value.

**Example:**
A 30-year zero-coupon bond is issued with an initial price of $400. Thirty years later the bondholder will receive the $1,000 par value. The $600 difference between the par value and the price represents the interest that would have been paid over the 30-year life of the bond.

**Optional:** Watch this one-minute video to see a real-world example of why zero-coupon bonds might be issued.

#### Serial Bonds

A serial bond issue is a bond offering in which a single issue is structured to mature in stages over several years, rather than all at once. In a serial issue, part of the principal is repaid each year or at set intervals until the entire issue is retired. Different maturities require different interest rates, so both the maturities and stated interest rates differ for the bonds in a serial issue. Most municipal bond issues and corporate equipment trust certificates are serial bonds.

**Example:**
In 2022, the City of Los Angeles issued $10,000,000 of serial bonds with the following maturity schedule:

| Maturity | Interest Rate | Amount |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| 2028 | 5.20% | $1,000,000 |
| 2029 | 5.30% | $1,000,000 |
| 2030 | 5.40% | $1,000,000 |
| 2031 | 5.50% | $1,000,000 |
| 2032 | 5.60% | $1,000,000 |
| 2033 | 6.00% | $5,000,000 |

The longer the time to maturity, the higher the interest rate that investors demand. Note, in this example, the City of Los Angeles designed their serial bond issuance so that the largest amount of the total of all bonds issued will mature in 2033—this is called a **balloon maturity**.

#### Series Bonds

The issue of bonds with the same maturity but different dates of issuance is a series bond issue. Series bonds are rare and are used to finance long-term construction projects where all the money is not needed at once. Instead of issuing a $10,000,000 bond issue today, a corporation could create a series bond issue, selling $5,000,000 of bonds this year, $3,000,000 next year, and $2,000,000 the following year, for a total issue of $10,000,000.

**Test-Taking Tip:** Do not confuse serial bonds and series bonds. A series bond is a bond issue where the bonds have the same maturity, but different dates of issuance. A serial bond issue is an issue with differing maturity dates.

### Topic 3: Bond Pricing and Quote Spread

#### Bond Quotes: Priced as a Percentage of Par

Most bond prices are quoted as a percentage of the par value. One point represents 1% of par, which usually amounts to $10 ($1,000 × .01 = $1,000). A percentage point of par value is sometimes called a **bond point**.

If a bond is quoted in points with no fraction, you can simply add a zero to the quote to get the dollar price.

**Examples:**
- A $1,000 par bond quoted at 80 points equals 80% of par. To buy this bond you would add a zero to the quote: 80(0) or points = $10 = $800, making the price $800.
- A $1,000 par bond quoted at 110 points equals 110% of par. To buy this bond you would add a zero, making the premium price: $1,100 (110 points = $10 = $1,100).

Corporate and municipal bonds are quoted using 1/8th of the par value per point. So if 1 point is equal to 1% of par or $10 (in the example above), 1/8 of a point would be: $1.25 (1 × 8 = 0.125).

Use this two-step method if the bond is quoted in fractions of a point:
- Step 1: Divide the numerator (top number) in the fraction by the denominator (bottom number).
- Step 2: Shift the decimal over one place to the right to calculate the dollar price.

**Example:**
- Step 1: A $1,000 par bond is quoted at 70 1/8.
- 1/8 = 0.125(1 ÷ 8 = 0.125), making the price of the bond equal to 70.125% of par.
- Step 2: Move the decimal one place to the right, making the dollar price $701.25.

U.S. government bonds are also quoted as a percentage of par value, in increments of 1/32 of a point. 1/32 of a point would be $0.3125. Remember, to turn a fraction into a decimal, just divide the numerator by the denominator: (1 ÷ 32 = 0.03125). Use the same two-step method to determine the bond's dollar price.

**Example:**
- Step 1: A $1,000 par Treasury bond is quoted at 80.8, meaning 80 8/32.
- 8/32 = 0.25 (8 ÷ 32 = 0.25), making the price of the bond equal to 80.25% of par.
- Step 2: Move the decimal one place to the right, making the dollar price for this issue $802.50.

Both corporate bonds and government bonds are quoted on a percentage of par basis because they are term bonds. Each bond within a term issue is identical and therefore has the same dollar price. Some government bonds are quoted in 1/64 of a percent instead of 1/32 of a percent. The same two-step calculation works regardless of the percentage of par being used.

#### Bid and Ask Spread

Dealers are firms that buy and sell bonds out of their own inventory. A dealer's bond quote is made up of two parts: the **bid** and the **ask**. The bid is the price at which the dealer is willing to buy a bond from an investor. The ask is the price at which the dealer is willing to sell a bond to an investor. For bonds, ask prices are always higher than bid prices.

The difference between the bid and the ask is called the **spread**. Spread plays a big part in how dealers make money. A dealer will buy low at the bid price and sell high at the ask price, earning the difference between the two prices.

**Example:**
A bond with a bid price of 98 means that the dealer is willing to buy the bond from the seller at 98 ($980). That same bond has an ask price of 100, which means that the dealer is willing to sell bonds to the buyer at 100 ($1,000).

**Bond Quote Example:**

| Dealer's Bid Price | Dealer's Ask Price (offer price) |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| 98 | 100 |

The profit that the dealer can earn is 2 points (or $20), or the difference between the bid and the ask ($1,000 - $980 = $20).

From the investor's perspective:
- The investor pays the dealer's ask price when they buy bonds.
- The investor receives the dealer's bid price when they sell bonds.

**Optional:** Watch this two-minute video that explains the parts of a bond quote and clarifies the bid price and the ask price.

#### Bond Quotes: Priced as a Yield

Some bonds are quoted on a percentage-of-par basis. Others are quoted based on their yield. Bond yield is the return an investor is expected to receive on a bond.

Yields are typically expressed in **basis points**. Basis points, also known as bps (pronounced as "bips"), are a unit of measure used to describe the percentage change in the value of a financial instrument.

In the bond market, a basis point is used to refer to the yield that a bond pays to the investor. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01% (0.01% of a percent) or 0.0001 in decimal form. So each percentage of yield is made up of 100 basis points.

**Example:**
Bond A is yielding (returning) 5%, while Bond B is yielding 6%. The difference between the yield of the two bonds is 100 basis points.

If Bond A is returning 4.50% and Bond B is yielding 4.50%, then the two bonds are 50 basis points apart in yield.

To convert basis points into percentage points, move the decimal point two places to the left.

**Examples:**
- 1 basis point equals .01% of a bond (take the 1.0 bps and move the decimal two places to the left = 0.01%)
- 10 basis points equal .1% (take the 10.0 bps and move the decimal two places to the left = 0.1%)
- 100 basis points equal 1 full point or 1% (take the 100.0 bps and move the decimal two places to the left = 1.00%)

| Basis Points | Percentage | Number as a Calculation |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|
| 100 bps | 1% | 0.01 |
| 10 bps | 0.1% | 0.001 |
| 1 bps | 0.01% | 0.0001 |

**Summary of how various bond types are quoted:**

| Bond Issuer | Quoted On | Type of Bond |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Corporation | Percentage-of-par basis | Term bond |
| U.S. government | Percentage-of-par basis | Term bond |
| Municipality | Percentage-of-par basis | Term bond (dollar bonds) |
| Municipality | Yield basis | Serial bond |

## Section 2: The Effect of Interest Rate Movements on Bond Prices and Yields

### Introduction

The primary risk for fixed-income securities is changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the price of existing bonds will either rise or fall. The expected return on a bond is often referred to as the bond's yield. There are several ways to measure yield.

### Key Concepts

After finishing this section, you should be familiar with the following topics:
- The Inverse Relationship Between Price and Yield
- Bond Yields

---

### Topic 1: The Inverse Relationship Between Price and Yield

The coupon rate on a newly issued bond is based on current market interest rates for similar bonds.

**Example:**
If the current rate of interest on a 10-year AA bond is 5%, this means that a new 10-year bond of an issuer with an "AA" rating will usually be issued at par with a 5% coupon. The nominal yield is another term for a bond's fixed coupon rate. Yet another term is **stated yield**.

**Current yield** on a bond is the annual interest divided by the current market price. If an investor pays par value of $1,000 for a bond with a 5% coupon rate, they will receive $50 in annual interest. The current yield will be $50 ÷ $1,000 = 5. In this case, the current yield and nominal yield are the same.

Current yield represents the annual rate of return that an investor will receive, given what they paid for the bond.

The market price of the bond will adjust over time as interest rates change. This price adjustment moves the current yield of the existing bonds in line with that of newly issued bonds. Nominal yield does not change with movements in interest rates.

If interest rates rise, the price of existing bonds will fall.

**Example:**
Bond X has a 5% coupon. If interest rates rise to 6%, Bond X is less attractive compared with newly issued bonds paying the higher rate. Bond X will now trade at a **discount** to encourage buyers to purchase these less attractive bonds. The price of Bond X will drop to a level where it yields 6% to be competitive with the market rate.

On the other hand, what happens if interest rates fall? The prices of existing bonds trading in the secondary market will rise.

**Example:**
Bond X has a 5% coupon. If interest rates fall to 4%, Bond X is more attractive compared with newly issued bonds paying the lower rate. Bond X will now trade at a **premium** since buyers will pay more for these more attractive bonds. The price of Bond X will rise to a level where it yields 4%, the same as the yield on newly issued bonds.

**Key Principle - Inverse Relationship:**
- When interest rates **RISE**, existing bond prices **FALL**.
- When interest rates **FALL**, existing bond prices **RISE**.
- Prices on existing bonds will rise or fall enough to bring the bond's yield in line with the return offered on newly issued bonds.

**Optional:** Watch this one-minute video to reinforce the relationship between interest rate risk and bond prices.

### Topic 2: Bond Yields

The term yield refers to the return on various investments. The FTM is the return on the current yield, which is the return on the investor's coupon basis point.

#### Bond Pricing at Par

A bond is issued with a coupon rate of 5%. This return is based on the coupon and is the investor's nominal yield. Also, if the current market interest rate is 5%, then the bond is trading at par. The investors will buy and sell the issue at $1,000 with a current yield of 5%.

| Bond Yield Type | Coupon Rate | Current Yield | Yield to Maturity |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Par | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| Discount | Coupon Rate > | Current Yield > | Yield to Maturity |
| Premium | Coupon Rate < | Current Yield < | Yield to Maturity |

A bond is issued with a nominal (coupon) rate of 5% per year. At this time all yields are equal. The YTM is the return on the current yield, which is the return on the investor's coupon basis point.

**Changes in Bond Yields:**

An investor is issued with a nominal (coupon) rate of 5.00%. This return is based on the coupon and is the investor's nominal yield. Also, if the current market interest rate is 5.00%, the bond is trading at par. The investors will buy and sell the issue at $1,000 with a current yield of 5.00% - $1,000 = 5.00%. At this time, all yields are equal. The YTM is the return on the current yield in the investor's coupon basis point.

An investor is issued with a nominal (coupon) rate of 5.00%. This return is based on the coupon and is the investor's nominal yield. If the current market yield rises to $1,100 – 5.00% = 4.55%, the price of the bond will fall to $1,100. At this time, the investors will buy and sell the issue at $1,100, Therefore, the FTM a current trading price will also be 5.00%.

#### Par Bond

A bond is issued with a 5% coupon at par/annual at a discount on par of 4% of $1,000, with an YMD.

Here is the calculation of current yield for this discount bond: $50 ÷ $909.1 = 5.5 FTM.

The current yield will be higher than the current yield of 5.0%.

#### Discount Bond

When a bond is purchased at a discount, the current yield will be higher than the nominal yield. The investor's yield to maturity will be higher than both the nominal yield and current yield. Due to the interest received, the investor will also the difference between the discounted buy price and the par value when they sell receive at maturity.

**Example:**
Investor A buys an XYZ coupon is purchased at a discount price of 110% of $1,000, with an YMD.

Here is the calculation of current yield for this discount bond: $50 ÷ $909.1 = 5.5%.

The yield to maturity will be lower than $50 because the price of the issue is $909.09 (that discount price where the bond is trading).

#### Premium Bond

When a bond is purchased at a premium, the current yield will be lower than the nominal yield. The investor's yield to maturity will be lower than both the nominal and current yields. Due to the interest earned, the investor will also the difference between the discounted buy price and the par value when they sell at maturity.

**Example:**
Investor A buys an XYZ bond is purchased at a premium price of 110% of $1,000, with an YMD.

Here is the calculation of current yield for this premium bond: $50 ÷ $1,100 = 4.55%.

The yield to maturity will be lower than $50 because the price of the issue is $909.09 (that discount price) where the bond is trading.

A yield (YMD) base three the coupon represents is a **percentage**.

**Example:**
- Bond B quoted at a yield basis.
- Coupon rate: 5.0%
- Dealer's current quote: 4.50%
- Bond B is selling at par.

There is an **inverse relationship** between par yield. Yields move in the opposite direction from dollar market prices for a bond quoted in a yield basis. A yield greater than the coupon represents a **discount**.

**Example:**
- Bond B is quoted at a yield basis.
- Coupon rate: 5.0%
- Dealer's current quote: 5.50%
- Bond B is selling at a discount of 50 basis points.

A yield (YMD) lower than the coupon represents a **premium**.

**Example:**
- Bond B quoted at a yield basis.
- Coupon rate: 5.0%
- Dealer's current quote: 4.50%
- Bond B is selling at a premium of 50 basis points.

To summarize, yield-based quotes are the opposite of dollar-based quotes when quoted in a percentage of par. This is why the inverse relationship between par yield. When the bond price goes up, yield goes down, and the opposite is true. When the bond price goes down, the yield goes up.

**Test-Taking Tip:** Although you will not have to calculate the yield to maturity, you will need to know that for a premium bond, the yield to maturity will be less than the current yield.

**Test-Taking Tip:** Although you will not have to calculate the yield to maturity, you will need to know that for a discount bond, the yield to maturity will be greater than the current yield.

**Optional:** The three minute video walks you through a market return explanation for the new formula.

**Optional:** Take a minute to see how this video explains the relationship between current yield and yield to maturity.
