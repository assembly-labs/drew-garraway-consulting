## Section 1: Bond Basics and Pricing

In 1693, England was at war with France and nearly broke. King William III needed money fast. His
solution: sell bonds to the public—promises to repay with interest. The Bank of England was created
specifically to manage this debt. That basic structure—borrow now, pay interest later, repay
principal at maturity—hasn't changed in over 300 years.

Today, the U.S. bond market exceeds $50 trillion. If you're going to advise clients on fixed income,
you need to understand how these instruments work at a fundamental level.

### Why This Section Matters

When investors lend money to corporations, governments, or municipalities, they receive bonds as
evidence of that loan. Unlike equity investors who hope for growth, bond investors want
predictability: regular interest payments and return of their principal. The trade-off is upside
potential for downside protection—bondholders get paid before stockholders if a company fails.

---

### Topic 1: What Is a Bond?

#### The Lending Relationship

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The word "bond" comes from the same root as "bind"—as in a binding agreement. When you buy a bond, the issuer is legally bound to pay you. This legal obligation is what makes bonds fundamentally different from stocks. A company can skip dividends without consequence; skip a bond payment and creditors can force bankruptcy.</p>
</div>

A <span class="key-term">bond</span> is a fixed-income security that represents a loan from an
investor to an issuer that needs capital—typically a corporation, government entity, or
municipality. The issuer promises to pay interest periodically and repay the
<span class="key-term">principal</span> (the original loan amount) at
<span class="key-term">maturity</span>.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Key Relationship</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Perspective</th>
      <th>Role</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bond Issuer</td>
      <td>Borrower = Debtor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bond Investor</td>
      <td>Lender = Creditor</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Unlike stockholders who own a piece of the business, bondholders are creditors who are owed money.
The bond itself is evidence of the issuer's <span class="key-term">indebtedness</span> to the
investor.

#### Par Value and Coupon Rate

Bonds are issued with a stated face value called <span class="key-term">par value</span>—typically
$1,000 for corporate and government bonds. The bond pays interest based on its
<span class="key-term">coupon rate</span> (also called the <span class="key-term">stated rate</span>
or <span class="key-term">nominal yield</span>)—the annual interest rate applied to the par value.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Bond Interest Example</div>
  <p>ABC Corporation issues a $1,000 par value bond with an 8% coupon rate.</p>
  <p>Annual interest = $1,000 × 8% = <strong>$80 per year</strong></p>
  <p>Interest is typically paid semiannually, so the bondholder receives $40 every six months.</p>
  <p>At maturity, the investor receives the final coupon payment ($40) plus the $1,000 principal = <strong>$1,040 total</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Unless told otherwise, assume bond interest is paid semiannually. Read carefully—some questions ask for annual interest ($80), others ask for the next semiannual payment ($40). This is a common trap.</p>
</div>

#### Bond Certificate Types

Bonds have evolved from physical paper to electronic records:

<div class="comparison-table">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Certificate Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Status</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Bearer Bonds</strong></td>
      <td>No owner name printed; whoever holds the bond can collect payments. Also called "coupon bonds" (had physical coupons to clip)</td>
      <td>No longer issued; some remain outstanding</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Registered Bonds</strong></td>
      <td>Owner's name printed on certificate; must be endorsed to transfer</td>
      <td>Largely replaced</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Book-Entry Bonds</strong></td>
      <td>No physical certificate; ownership recorded electronically at a central depository</td>
      <td>Current standard</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

When bonds are held in <span class="key-term">street name</span>, the broker-dealer is listed as
owner rather than the customer. The customer remains the <span class="key-term">beneficial
owner</span> and retains all benefits—interest payments, transfer rights, and principal repayment.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> U.S. government and agency securities are now issued <em>only</em> in book-entry form. No paper certificates exist for new Treasury issues.</p>
</div>

(Anyone who's watched a heist movie knows bearer bonds are the villain's favorite—anonymous and
negotiable. That's exactly why they were phased out. The IRS prefers knowing who owns what.)

---

### Topic 2: Bond Structure

Different bonds are structured differently based on how they mature and pay interest.

#### Term Bonds

A <span class="key-term">term bond</span> issue has every bond maturing on the same date with the
same interest rate. Corporate bonds and U.S. government bonds are typically term bond issues.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Term Bond Example</div>
  <p>ABC Corporation issues $1,000,000 of 8%, $1,000 par bonds, all maturing in 30 years.</p>
  <p>Every bond within the issue is identical—same maturity date, same coupon rate, same payment schedule.</p>
</div>

#### Zero-Coupon Bonds

<span class="key-term">Zero-coupon bonds</span> pay no periodic interest. Instead, they're sold at a
deep <span class="key-term">discount</span> from par and redeemed at full par value at maturity. The
difference between purchase price and redemption value represents the interest earned.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Zero-Coupon Example</div>
  <p>A 30-year zero-coupon bond is issued at $400.</p>
  <p>At maturity, the bondholder receives $1,000 par value.</p>
  <p>The $600 difference ($1,000 - $400) represents the interest that would have been paid over 30 years—just received all at once at the end.</p>
</div>

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Zero-Coupons Exist</div>
  <p>Zero-coupon bonds solve a specific problem: reinvestment risk. With regular bonds, you receive interest payments and must find somewhere to invest them. With zeros, there's nothing to reinvest—your return is locked in at purchase. Investors saving for a specific future goal (like college tuition in 18 years) love this certainty.</p>
</div>

#### Serial Bonds

A <span class="key-term">serial bond</span> issue matures in stages over several years rather than
all at once. Part of the principal is repaid at set intervals until the entire issue is retired.
Because different maturities carry different risk levels, serial bonds have varying interest rates.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Serial Bond Example</div>
  <p>In 2022, the City of Los Angeles issued $10,000,000 of serial bonds:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Maturity</th>
      <th>Interest Rate</th>
      <th>Amount</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2028</td>
      <td>5.20%</td>
      <td>$1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2029</td>
      <td>5.30%</td>
      <td>$1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2030</td>
      <td>5.40%</td>
      <td>$1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2031</td>
      <td>5.50%</td>
      <td>$1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2032</td>
      <td>5.60%</td>
      <td>$1,000,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2033</td>
      <td>6.00%</td>
      <td>$5,000,000</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Notice: longer maturities command higher rates (investors demand more compensation for longer-term risk). The largest portion maturing last is called a <strong>balloon maturity</strong>.</p>
</div>

Most <span class="key-term">municipal bonds</span> and corporate <span class="key-term">equipment
trust certificates</span> are issued as serial bonds.

#### Series Bonds

<span class="key-term">Series bonds</span> have the same maturity but different issuance dates.
They're used for long-term construction projects where funds aren't needed all at once.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Series Bond Example</div>
  <p>Instead of issuing $10,000,000 today, a corporation creates a series bond issue:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Year 1: $5,000,000 issued</li>
    <li>Year 2: $3,000,000 issued</li>
    <li>Year 3: $2,000,000 issued</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All bonds mature on the same date, but they were sold at different times.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Don't confuse serial and series bonds—they sound similar but are opposites:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Serial:</strong> Same issuance date, different maturity dates</li>
    <li><strong>Series:</strong> Different issuance dates, same maturity date</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Topic 3: Bond Pricing and Quote Spreads

Understanding how bonds are quoted and priced is essential for the exam and for real-world trading.

#### Bond Quotes: Percentage of Par

Most bonds are quoted as a percentage of par value. One <span class="key-term">bond point</span>
equals 1% of par, which is $10 for a $1,000 par bond.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Quick Conversion</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Bond Quote × $10 = Dollar Price</div>
  <p>For whole-number quotes, simply add a zero to get the dollar price.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Bond Quote Examples</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Quote</th>
      <th>Percentage of Par</th>
      <th>Dollar Price</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>80</td>
      <td>80%</td>
      <td>$800 (discount)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>100%</td>
      <td>$1,000 (par)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>110</td>
      <td>110%</td>
      <td>$1,100 (premium)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Fractional Bond Quotes

Corporate and municipal bonds are quoted in eighths (1/8 = $1.25).

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Two-Step Method for Fractions</div>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Convert the fraction to a decimal (divide numerator by denominator)</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move the decimal one place right to get the dollar amount</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Fractional Quote Example</div>
  <p>A bond is quoted at 70 1/8:</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 1/8 = 0.125, so the quote is 70.125% of par</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move decimal right → <strong>$701.25</strong></p>
</div>

U.S. government bonds are quoted in thirty-seconds (1/32 = $0.3125). The same two-step method
applies.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Government Bond Quote Example</div>
  <p>A Treasury bond is quoted at 80.8 (meaning 80 and 8/32):</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 8/32 = 0.25, so the quote is 80.25% of par</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move decimal right → <strong>$802.50</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Government bonds use 32nds (and sometimes 64ths). Corporate/municipal bonds use 8ths. This is a frequent exam question.</p>
</div>

#### Bid-Ask Spread

<span class="key-term">Dealers</span> buy and sell bonds from their own inventory. Their quotes have
two parts:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Bid vs. Ask</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Term</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
      <th>From Investor's View</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Bid</strong></td>
      <td>Price dealer will pay to buy from you</td>
      <td>Price you receive when selling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Ask (Offer)</strong></td>
      <td>Price dealer will accept to sell to you</td>
      <td>Price you pay when buying</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The <strong>spread</strong> is the difference between bid and ask—this is how dealers profit.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Bid-Ask Example</div>
  <p>Dealer quotes: Bid 98, Ask 100</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you sell to the dealer: you receive $980 (bid price)</li>
    <li>If you buy from the dealer: you pay $1,000 (ask price)</li>
    <li>Dealer's profit: $20 spread (2 points × $10)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Remember: the ask is always higher than the bid. Investors always get the worse end of the deal—pay high (ask) when buying, receive low (bid) when selling. That's how dealers stay in business.</p>
</div>

#### Bond Quotes: Yield Basis

Some bonds—particularly municipal serial bonds—are quoted based on yield rather than price.
<span class="key-term">Basis points</span> (bps, pronounced "bips") are the standard unit: 1 basis
point = 0.01% = 0.0001.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Basis Point Conversion</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Move the decimal two places left to convert bps to percentage</div>

</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Basis Point Example</div>
  <p>Bond A yields 5%, Bond B yields 6%.</p>
  <p>The yield difference = 1% = <strong>100 basis points</strong></p>

## Section 2: Interest Rates, Bond Prices, and Yields

In 1981, 10-year Treasury bonds yielded nearly 16%—an investor could lock in that rate for a decade
with U.S. government backing. Investors who bought then watched their bond prices soar as rates fell
over the following years. Those who waited and bought in 2020 at 0.5% rates learned the opposite
lesson when rates rose sharply in 2022. The relationship between interest rates and bond prices is
the most important concept in fixed income.

### Why This Section Matters

Interest rate risk is the primary risk for bondholders. When rates move, your bond's value moves in
the opposite direction. Understanding this inverse relationship—and the different ways to measure
bond yields—is essential for advising clients and passing the exam.

---

### Topic 1: The Inverse Relationship Between Price and Yield

When a bond is issued, its coupon rate reflects current market rates for similar securities. But
once issued, the bond's market price will fluctuate as interest rates change.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why This Relationship Exists</div>
  <p>Imagine you own a bond paying 5% when newly issued bonds suddenly pay 6%. Why would anyone buy your 5% bond at full price when they could get 6% elsewhere? They wouldn't—unless your bond's price dropped enough to make its effective yield competitive. This is the fundamental driver of bond price movements.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">The Iron Law of Bond Investing</div>
  <p>There is an <strong>inverse relationship</strong> between interest rates and bond prices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When interest rates <strong>RISE</strong>, existing bond prices <strong>FALL</strong></li>
    <li>When interest rates <strong>FALL</strong>, existing bond prices <strong>RISE</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prices adjust so that existing bonds offer yields competitive with newly issued securities.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Interest Rate Impact Example</div>
  <p><strong>Scenario 1: Rates Rise</strong></p>
  <p>Bond X has a 5% coupon. Market rates rise to 6%.</p>
  <p>Bond X becomes less attractive—new bonds pay more. Bond X's price falls until its yield equals 6%.</p>
  <p>Result: Bond X trades at a <strong>discount</strong> (below par).</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Scenario 2: Rates Fall</strong></p>
  <p>Bond X has a 5% coupon. Market rates fall to 4%.</p>
  <p>Bond X becomes more attractive—it pays more than new bonds. Buyers bid up the price.</p>
  <p>Result: Bond X trades at a <strong>premium</strong> (above par).</p>
</div>

(Bondholders in 2022 learned this lesson the hard way—the fastest rate increases in 40 years sent
bond prices tumbling. Meanwhile, the inverse works both ways: bond investors in the 1980s who locked
in 15% yields watched their bond values climb steadily as rates fell over the next four decades.)

### Topic 2: Understanding Bond Yields

<span class="key-term">Yield</span> measures the return an investor earns on a bond. There are
several ways to calculate yield, and they tell you different things.

#### Nominal Yield (Coupon Rate)

<span class="key-term">Nominal yield</span> is simply the coupon rate—the fixed interest rate stated
on the bond. Also called the <span class="key-term">stated yield</span>.

A 5% coupon bond always has a 5% nominal yield, regardless of what happens to market prices or
interest rates. Nominal yield never changes.

#### Current Yield

<span class="key-term">Current yield</span> measures the annual return based on what you actually
paid for the bond:

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Current Yield = Annual Interest ÷ Current Market Price</div>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Current Yield at Par</div>
  <p>Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon, trading at $1,000 (par)</p>
  <p>Annual Interest = $50</p>
  <p>Current Yield = $50 ÷ $1,000 = <strong>5%</strong></p>
  <p>At par, current yield equals nominal yield.</p>
</div>

#### Current Yield for Discount Bonds

When a bond trades below par, current yield exceeds nominal yield—you're earning the same dollar
interest on a smaller investment.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Discount Bond Current Yield</div>
  <p>Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon, trading at $909.09 (discount)</p>
  <p>Annual Interest = $50</p>
  <p>Current Yield = $50 ÷ $909.09 = <strong>5.5%</strong></p>
  <p>The investor pays less but receives the same $50 annually—higher effective return.</p>
</div>

#### Current Yield for Premium Bonds

When a bond trades above par, current yield is less than nominal yield—you're earning the same
dollar interest on a larger investment.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Premium Bond Current Yield</div>
  <p>Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon, trading at $1,100 (premium)</p>
  <p>Annual Interest = $50</p>
  <p>Current Yield = $50 ÷ $1,100 = <strong>4.55%</strong></p>
  <p>The investor pays more but receives only $50 annually—lower effective return.</p>
</div>

#### Yield to Maturity (YTM)

<span class="key-term">Yield to maturity</span> is the most comprehensive yield measure. It accounts
for:

- Annual interest payments
- The difference between purchase price and par value at maturity
- Time until maturity

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Yield Relationship Rules</div>
  <p><strong>For Discount Bonds:</strong></p>
  <p>Nominal Yield < Current Yield < Yield to Maturity</p>
  <p>YTM is highest because you also gain the discount when the bond matures at par.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>For Premium Bonds:</strong></p>
  <p>Nominal Yield > Current Yield > Yield to Maturity</p>
  <p>YTM is lowest because you lose the premium when the bond matures at par.</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>For Par Bonds:</strong></p>
  <p>Nominal Yield = Current Yield = Yield to Maturity</p>
  <p>All yields equal when trading at par.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> You won't calculate YTM on the exam, but you must know: for discount bonds, YTM > current yield. For premium bonds, YTM < current yield. Remember: discounts add to your return; premiums subtract.</p>
</div>

#### Yield-Based Quotes and Price Movement

When bonds are quoted on a yield basis (common for municipal serial bonds), the inverse relationship
still applies:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Yield Quote Examples</div>
  <p><strong>Bond B:</strong> 5% coupon, quoted at 5.00% yield</p>
  <p>Result: Trading at <strong>par</strong> (yield = coupon)</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Bond B:</strong> 5% coupon, quoted at 5.50% yield</p>
  <p>Result: Trading at a <strong>discount</strong> (yield > coupon)</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Bond B:</strong> 5% coupon, quoted at 4.50% yield</p>
  <p>Result: Trading at a <strong>premium</strong> (yield < coupon)</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Price vs. Yield Movement</div>
  <p>For yield-based quotes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When quoted yield <strong>rises</strong>, dollar price <strong>falls</strong></li>
    <li>When quoted yield <strong>falls</strong>, dollar price <strong>rises</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The inverse relationship holds regardless of how the bond is quoted.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Questions may describe yield changes in basis points. If a bond's yield rises by 50 basis points, its price fell. If yield drops by 25 basis points, its price rose. The inverse relationship always holds.</p>
</div>
