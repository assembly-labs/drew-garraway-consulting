## Section 1: Types of Trading Markets

On a spring morning in 1792, twenty-four merchants gathered beneath a buttonwood tree on Wall Street and agreed to trade only with each other. That handshake deal—formalized as the Buttonwood Agreement—gave birth to organized securities trading in America. For over two centuries afterward, "trading" meant humans shouting at each other on a physical floor, waving paper tickets, and occasionally getting into fistfights over disputed prices.

Today, most trades happen in microseconds across electronic networks, and the term "exchange" has expanded far beyond any physical location. Understanding where and how securities trade is fundamental to everything else you'll learn about the markets.

### Why This Section Matters

The securities industry uses a numbering system to categorize different trading venues. These aren't arbitrary labels—they reflect real differences in how trades are executed, who participates, and what rules apply. Knowing the distinction between first, second, third, and fourth markets helps you understand market structure and answer exam questions correctly.

---

### Topic 1: Overview of Trading Markets

#### Primary vs. Secondary Markets

Before diving into the numbered markets, let's clarify a fundamental distinction: the <span class="key-term">primary market</span> is where new securities are sold to the public for the first time—initial public offerings (IPOs) and new bond issues. The <span class="key-term">secondary market</span> is where those securities trade afterward between investors.

The numbered markets (first, second, third, fourth) are all subdivisions of the secondary market—different venues where previously issued securities change hands.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The distinction between exchange and over-the-counter trading goes back centuries. Exchanges were formal buildings with membership rules; OTC trading happened informally in coffee houses and on street corners. The technology has changed dramatically, but the conceptual distinction persists.</p>
</div>

---

### First Market: Exchange Trading

The <span class="key-term">first market</span> refers to the trading of exchange-listed securities on a major stock exchange. Exchanges have specific listing requirements, and securities that trade on an exchange are called <span class="key-term">listed securities</span>. Securities that trade on an exchange can be called <span class="key-term">listed securities</span>.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">The Major U.S. Stock Exchanges</div>
  <p>The largest stock exchange with a physical trading floor is the <strong>New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</strong>. Over the years, the NYSE has acquired other exchanges such as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), which was renamed the NYSE American. The NYSE is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which also owns many other exchanges.</p>
  <p>The largest U.S. stock exchange is <strong>Nasdaq</strong>, which has no physical trading floor.</p>
</div>

#### Consolidated Quotation System (CQS)

The <span class="key-term">Consolidated Quotation System (CQS)</span> creates current price quotes (best actual traded prices) for exchange-listed securities, regardless of where the quote is generated or exchanged. This allows price discovery between markets. In that case, a customer can perform an arbitrage trade by buying the security in one market and immediately selling in another market to lock in an immediate profit.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The CQS consolidates tape data continuously and shows data on trading prices and price for exchange-listed securities. This allows price discovery between markets.</p>
</div>

Once a trade occurs in an exchange-listed security, it is reported to the Consolidated Tape System (CTS), also known as the Consolidated Tape. The consolidated tape publishes continuous real-time data on trading prices and volumes for exchange-listed securities.

#### NYSE Designated Market Makers (DMMs)

A <span class="key-term">designated market maker (DMM)</span> is a firm that specializes in trading of securities. DMMs are wholesalers of securities and only deal with the members of the NYSE (mostly large brokerage firms and trading firms). Market makers always offer to buy at one price (the bid) and sell at a higher price (the ask). Morgan Stanley and Citadel Securities are current DMMs.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">The Evolution of Market Making</div>
  <p>NYSE AMEX-listed securities is a specific firm. DMM takes charge of securities over time to ensure fair, orderly and continuous exchange-listed securities.</p>
</div>

Traditionally, the NYSE was an <span class="key-term">auction market</span> where buyers and sellers bid for securities, and the DMM ran the auction (could participate as a buyer or seller). The market makers have been replaced by an electronic display book (EDB) known as the DMM.

#### Options Trading

There are also options exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and the Philadelphia Exchange (now known as Nasdaq PHLX). They trade standardized options contracts that are created for exchange. The only OTC options are dealer derivatives contracts. The key OTC options and custom derivative contracts.

---

### Second Market: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading

#### OTC Trading of Unlisted Stocks

Many securities cannot meet an exchange's listing requirements. Other issuers may choose not to list on an exchange. Such securities can be traded <span class="key-term">over-the-counter (OTC)</span>. Some OTC issues are highly speculative. Many are <span class="key-term">penny stocks</span>, so called because their share prices can be measured in cents.

#### Bond Trading

Almost all corporate bonds and all money market instruments trade OTC. U.S. government bonds and municipal bonds trade OTC. The government securities market is loosely regulated by the Federal Reserve through its relationship with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), which mandates a reporting system for OTC trades of NMS securities.

#### OTC Markets Group

OTC Markets Group displays quotes for stocks not listed on exchanges. Unlike the NYSE or Nasdaq, it does not require issuers report to a self-regulatory organization (SRO). Trades are negotiated between dealers, either online or over the phone.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">OTC Markets Group Tiers</div>
  <p>OTC Markets Group has 3 separate markets based on the level of financial disclosures provided by the issuer. These 3 companies, in descending order of quality, are the following markets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OTCQX</strong> (premium companies)</li>
    <li><strong>OTCQB</strong> (best-researched companies)</li>
    <li><strong>Pink Market</strong> (speculative companies)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

OTC securities are typically thinly traded, volatile, and highly speculative. Many are <span class="key-term">penny stocks</span>, so called because their share prices can be measured in cents.

---

### Third Market: OTC Trading of Exchange-Listed Issues

OTC firms may also trade securities that are otherwise exchange-listed. This is the <span class="key-term">third market</span>. Most market participants are typically institutional investors or broker-dealers.

Most OTC trading of exchange-listed securities is conducted via <span class="key-term">electronic communication networks (ECNs)</span>. An ECN is not an exchange itself, but rather a matching service that automatically matches orders from securities. Market makers, ECNs may include institutional investors, broker-dealers, and retail market makers. Individuals who wish to trade through an ECN typically do so through a broker-dealer (though on some ECNs private individuals with retail accounts can access directly).

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">ECN Advantages</div>
  <p>The advantages of trading on an ECN include lower costs compared to trading on an exchange, and the ability for institutional investors to trade directly with other members without using a broker as an intermediary. They are often open 24 hours a day and can make trades anonymously. Finally, order market maker systems handle small orders more quickly.</p>
</div>

An ECN that is linked to the Nasdaq Market Center or some other exchange is called a <span class="key-term">linked ECN</span>. An <span class="key-term">unlinked ECN</span> is an ECN that is not linked to an exchange, and its quotes are not displayed on that system. An ECN, whether linked or unlinked, must still be registered with an SRO to operate legally and provide fair, accurate best execution.

The SEC requires that member firms route their orders to the market that is posting the best available price. So, if a third market maker is offering an NYSE-listed stock for a price lower than can be obtained on the NYSE floor, the order generally must be given to that third market maker.

---

### Fourth Market: Direct Trading Between Institutions

The fourth market is the direct trading of securities between institutions without the use of a broker. Large institutions will maintain their own OTC trading venues where large trades (such as block trades) can be made between firms.

A <span class="key-term">dark pool</span> is a private trading system that allows participants to make transactions without displaying quotes to the public. Dark pool participants do not be identifiable making large transactions that do not affect their appearances to the public, so their trading activities do not affect the price of the security. If there is an unfinished block of an exchange block security in a dark pool, it does not, however, the trade must be reported to the consolidated tape.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Why Dark Pools Exist</div>
  <p>The regulatory requirements of Regulation ATS apply to alternative trading systems. Regulation ATS requires every alternative trading system to register with the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) as broker-dealers. No ATS may use the word "exchange" in its name, but an ATS otherwise functions as an exchange. No SEC may require it to become an exchange.</p>
</div>

If an ATS has more than 5% of the trading volume of an exchange-listed stock and displays orders to non-ATS traders, then ATS must provide public display. The ATS must publicly display the best bid and ask prices for that stock on an exchange. It must also allow any broker-dealer trading access to those quotes to complete a transaction, whether or not it is an ATS transaction. In addition, an ATS must also follow the rules related to the security of information, confidentiality, and reporting.

### Topic 2: Broker-Dealers and the Differences Between Brokers and Dealers

<span class="key-term">Broker-dealers</span> are firms that can act in one of two ways: as a broker or as a dealer.

When a firm acts as a <span class="key-term">broker</span>, it serves as an agent or go-between for the buyer and the seller. The broker earns agency commissions, which is paid by charging a fee. Transactions where a firm is acting as broker are called <span class="key-term">agency transactions</span>, since the firm is acting as an agent for the buyer or seller.

When the firm acts as a <span class="key-term">dealer</span>, it is putting its own money at risk by buying or selling securities out of its own inventory. Rather than brokering a deal for another party, the dealer is a principal to the trade. The dealer facilitates the trade by posting a bid and ask price. It profits by the spread between the bid and ask price, plus any markup or markdown that the dealer may receive. Transactions in which a firm acts as dealer are called <span class="key-term">principal transactions</span>.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Key Distinction</div>
  <p>A markup is added to the ask or offer price when a customer purchases a security. A <strong>markdown</strong> reduces the bid price when a customer sells a security. When a firm includes the markup or markdown in the price, it is called a <strong>net price</strong>. A firm may never charge both a commission and a markup or markdown on the same transaction. This is called a <strong>hidden profit</strong> and is prohibited.</p>
</div>

(The distinction between acting as agent versus principal is tested heavily—if you remember nothing else from this section, remember that brokers charge commissions and dealers make markups.)

#### Agency Cross

If a broker-dealer has one client who wants to sell a security and another client who is willing to buy the same security, the firm may execute an <span class="key-term">agency cross</span>. Both the buyer and seller are charged a commission by the firm which acts as an intermediary. The cross is typically executed at a price between the bid and the ask.

#### Riskless Principal Transactions

The only time a non-market maker may execute a principal transaction in the OTC market is if it is a <span class="key-term">riskless principal transaction</span>. A riskless principal transaction is when a non-market maker receives an order from a customer and then buys stock from a market maker to fulfill the order. Before delivering the stock to the customer, the stock is briefly credited to the firm's riskless principal account. The non-market maker then sells the stock from this account to the customer along with a markup.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Quote Example</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Security</th>
      <th>Firm's Bid Price</th>
      <th>Firm's Ask Price (Offer Price)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>XYZ Stock</td>
      <td>$9.90</td>
      <td>$10.00</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The difference between the two is the "spread." Actively traded stocks tend to have narrow spreads, while thinly traded stocks typically have wider bid-ask spreads.</p>
</div>

Bids and offers for equity securities in all the secondary markets are priced at the penny level as long as the stock price is above $1. Stocks that trade below $1 can be traded at increments of $0.0001 or more. In other words, sub-penny pricing is only allowed for stocks that trade at less than $1 per share.

Bids and offers on corporate bonds are typically quoted in eighths of a bond point. Municipal bonds are also quoted in eighths, or a bond point. Treasury bonds and notes are quoted in 32nds, while Treasury bills are quoted on a yield (discount to par) basis.

#### National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)

The <span class="key-term">National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)</span> is the highest bid and lowest ask price across all trading venues. In other words, the NBBO is the inside market across all trading venues.

#### NMS vs. OTC Securities

Another way to divide up the securities industry is by regulatory framework. The first framework is called the <span class="key-term">National Market System (NMS)</span>, and it was created by Congress to consolidate the trading rules across all the exchanges and to encourage competition among them. This legislation required that U.S. exchanges be linked together, which created both the consolidated tape and the Consolidated Quotation System. Within the NMS framework, securities listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and other U.S. exchanges are defined as <span class="key-term">NMS securities</span>. All trading of NMS securities is considered to be part of the NMS and subject to NMS regulations, even OTC trades of NMS securities.

Securities that are not NMS securities are referred to as <span class="key-term">OTC securities</span>. While the SEC often creates rules for NMS securities, OTC securities are regulated primarily by FINRA.

---

### FINRA's 5% Policy

FINRA regulates the trading of corporate securities in the secondary market. FINRA's policy is called the <span class="key-term">5% Policy</span>, which suggests that firms cannot charge more than 5% for a commission, markup, or markdown. Despite the name, 5% is merely a guideline. The actual rule states that a commission, markup, or markdown must be fair and reasonable based on the type and size of the transaction. <span class="key-term">Proceeds transactions</span> (the sale of a security to buy another) are viewed as a single transaction for purposes of this rule. (The firm may not charge 5% on both sides.)

FINRA adds some relevant factors to determine whether a markup/commission is fair and reasonable. They are:

- **The type of security involved**—the greater the risk, the higher the allowable markup (e.g., AAA corporate bonds would have a lower markup than BBB corporate bonds because AAA bonds carry a lower risk than BBB bonds)
- **The availability of the security in the market**—thinly traded stocks typically have higher markups
- **The price of the security**—the higher the price of the stock, the lower the markup
- **The amount of money involved in a transaction**—the higher the value of the total transaction, the lower the markup
- **The pattern of markups**—charging markups greater than the firm's established pattern can be a concern
- **The nature of the member's business**—if a member provides additional services and facilities to the customer, a higher markup may be justified

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Mutual funds are exempt from the 5% Policy (their maximum sales charge is 8.5%). Municipal bonds are also exempt from FINRA's 5% Policy, but the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) has a similar rule stating that markups/markdowns must be fair and reasonable.</p>
</div>

Securities requiring a prospectus (e.g., initial public offerings, mutual funds, variable annuities, and municipal securities) are generally exempt from the 5% Policy. However, government securities, such as Treasuries, are not exempt.

### Traders

To function, markets must be <span class="key-term">liquid</span>. There must be a lot of willing buyers and sellers at all times. The more buyers and sellers, the more liquid a market is. Thinly traded markets, such as the Pink Market, are less liquid and have wider spreads. The NYSE is highly liquid and has spreads that are typically only 1 cent (e.g., bid $4.25 – ask $4.26).

Firms will employ individuals to act as traders. When an order comes in, the trader will be responsible for finding the best price available from other broker-dealers or market makers.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Retail customers do not trade directly with market makers. A retail customer will place an order with their broker-dealer firm. The firm will send the customer's order to its trading desk, which will then find the best price available to execute the trade. Most trades will be filled electronically in a matter of seconds, but the customer is rarely directly involved in the buying or selling of a security. That is why the firm will charge a commission, markup, or markdown as a fee for its service.</p>
</div>

---

### Topic 3: Additional Information About Markets

#### Secondary Market Quotes

News transactions in exchange-listed securities are handled by market makers who buy and sell securities on behalf of their clients or for their own account. Market makers will quote prices at which they are willing to buy or sell a given security. These quotes are publicly available and must be honored by the market maker.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Market Maker Quote Example</div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Market Maker</th>
      <th>Bid</th>
      <th>Ask</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Market Maker A:</td>
      <td>$15.50</td>
      <td>$15.65</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Market Maker B:</td>
      <td>$15.40</td>
      <td>$15.58</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Market Maker C:</td>
      <td>$15.45</td>
      <td>$15.60</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>An investor who wishes to purchase shares will buy from the market maker with the lowest ask price. In this example, Market Maker B's ask of $15.58 is the best price.</p>
  <p>An investor who wishes to sell shares will sell to the market maker with the highest bid price. In this example, Market Maker A's bid of $15.50 is the best price.</p>
  <p>So, the inside market for this hypothetical stock would be $15.50 – $15.55. The difference between the bid and ask price, in this example $.05, is called the <strong>spread</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Actively traded securities typically have narrow bid-ask spreads, while thinly traded securities typically have wider bid-ask spreads.</p>
</div>

A dealer's quote is good for a minimum of a round lot (100 shares). If the dealer stands ready to buy or sell more than 1 round lot, this will appear as part of the quote. For example, if a dealer's spread is 14.50 × 3 – 14.60 × 5, this means the dealer stands ready to buy up to 3 round lots at $14.50/share and sell up to 5 round lots at $14.60/share.

---

### Trading Halts

A trading halt occurs when a regulator or trading venue orders that trading in a security or securities be suspended for some period of time. Here are the major kinds of trading halts that can be imposed by the SEC, FINRA, and the exchanges.

#### Regulatory Halts

Trading halts that occur because of market volatility are called <span class="key-term">non-regulatory halts</span>. (The name is slightly misleading because regulators developed the rules about when these "non-regulatory" halts occur.) Trading halts that occur for other reasons are called <span class="key-term">regulatory halts</span>.

#### News Pending Halts

There are two types of regulatory halts that you should know for the exam. The first is a <span class="key-term">news pending halt</span>, in which an exchange halts trading in a security whose price is likely to be influenced by upcoming news, such as a major announcement by the issuer. The news pending halt allows investors time to receive and digest the news before trading continues. Related securities, such as options, are generally halted as well. These pending halts usually last an hour or less.

An exchange's news pending halt only affects trading on that exchange. However, it is likely that other exchanges will impose their own halts for significant news. FINRA can impose news pending halts in OTC trading venues.

#### Summary Suspension of Trading

The SEC may summarily suspend trading in any non-exempt security for up to 10 business days. It also has the power to suspend all trading of non-exempt securities on any securities market for up to 90 days. The SEC can take these actions when it deems it necessary to protect investors.

#### Non-Regulatory Halts

This type of non-regulatory halt occurs in the event of a severe market decline. These halts apply to all securities trading on all exchanges and the OTC market. These halts are often referred to as <span class="key-term">circuit breakers</span>.

A market-wide trading halt will be triggered at 3 circuit breaker thresholds. These thresholds are triggered by steep declines in the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index. They are calculated based on the prior day's closing price of the index.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">Circuit Breaker Thresholds</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1 halt:</strong> A 7% drop in the S&P 500 before 3:25 p.m. ET will result in a 15-minute cross-market trading halt. There will be no halt if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2 halt:</strong> A 13% drop in the S&P 500 before 3:25 p.m. ET will result in a 15-minute cross-market trading halt. There will be no halt if the drop occurs at or after 3:25 p.m. ET.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3 halt:</strong> A 20% drop in the S&P 500 at any time during the day will result in a cross-market trading halt for the remainder of the day.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a maximum of one Level 1 halt per day. Likewise, Level 2 halts are limited to one per day.</p>
</div>

A broker-dealer may not trade or publish a quotation in any security for which a trading halt is in effect. A broker-dealer may accept a customer order for a security that is subject to a trading halt. However, the customer should be notified that there is a trading halt and that the order cannot be filled currently. The order will be executable when trading resumes.

FINRA prohibits member firms from attempting to circumvent a market-wide trading halt in any manner, such as trading the security on a foreign exchange or an unlisted ECN, or instructing a non-FINRA member affiliate to do so.

#### LULD (Limit Up-Limit Down) Pauses

FINRA and the exchanges have a system for automatically imposing trading pauses on any NMS stock whose bids and asks move sharply and suddenly. Under this <span class="key-term">Limit Up/Limit Down (LULD)</span> system, each NMS stock's bids and asks are tracked over the previous 5 minutes. If bids and asks move too much too quickly, the LULD system imposes a 5-minute trading pause in that stock across all exchanges and OTC trading venues.

#### Order Imbalance Trading Delays

When customers place more buy orders than sell orders (or more sell orders than buy orders) for a particular security, that security is said to have an <span class="key-term">order imbalance</span>. If an order imbalance is too extreme at the start of the trading day (perhaps due to events that occurred outside normal trading hours), an exchange can delay the start of trading in that security. This provides time for more sell orders (or buy orders) to be placed, thus reducing the order imbalance to a manageable size. These trading delays are usually short, lasting only a few minutes.

---

### After-Hours Market

Many alternative trading systems stay open 24 hours a day and execute trades when the NYSE and Nasdaq are closed. Customers who trade outside of regular exchange trading hours should be aware of these features:

- The after-hours market is much less liquid, order flow is very limited, and order execution is much more difficult and can be more costly.
- There is much greater price volatility along with wider spreads in the after-hours market, due to the limited order flow.

## Section 2: Basic Order Types

In 1867, Edward Calahan invented the stock ticker—a device that printed stock prices on paper tape, allowing investors to follow the market from outside the exchange for the first time. Before that, you had to be on the trading floor to know what was happening. The ticker transformed investing from a physical presence game to an information game.

Today, information travels in nanoseconds, but the fundamental order types haven't changed much. Understanding how orders work—and which type to use in different situations—is essential for passing the exam and advising clients.

### Why This Section Matters

Every trade starts with an order. The type of order determines how and when the trade will be executed, and at what price. Getting this wrong can cost clients money or expose them to unintended risks.

---

### Steps in a Typical Securities Trade

1. An investor contacts a broker to buy or sell securities. All orders must be entered verbally with the RR or through the customer's online account. Entering orders through texts or emails is not permitted.
2. A broker representative places the investor's order either by telephoning a trader or by using an electronic trading network.
3. The order is routed to an exchange (NYSE or Nasdaq), a market maker, an ECN, or a registered ATS or other dark pool that electronically matches buyers and sellers and does not require the use of an exchange or a market maker.
4. The order is executed.
5. The trade is reported to an exchange or via a trade reporting facility (TRF), then to the consolidated tape.
6. The trade is cleared and settled. Clearance is the reconciliation of the information in a trade between the parties. Settlement is the final step when money and securities are exchanged, typically 1 business day after the order is placed (T+1).

There are a variety of ways to classify orders, including the action (buy or sell), the timing of the order, and the size of the order. The order types in this section generally refer to stock trades.

---

### Topic 1: Basic Order Types

#### Buy and Sell Orders

There are two basic types of orders: buy orders and sell orders. These orders can either be initial orders (to open a position) or closing orders (to close a position). An initial order to buy is called a <span class="key-term">long position</span>, while an initial order to sell is called a <span class="key-term">short position</span>.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Long Position Example</div>
  <p><strong>Long Position:</strong> A customer places an order to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock. When a willing seller is found, the order is filled (executed). The customer now owns 100 shares of XYZ stock. A long stock position is bullish, meaning that the customer believes the price of the stock will rise.</p>
</div>

#### Shorting Stock

When a customer shorts stock, they borrow the stock through their broker-dealer and then sell these borrowed shares (an opening sale), hoping the price of the stock will decline. In the future, the customer will need to close out their short position with a closing purchase. To do so, they would buy the same number of shares of the same stock to return the stock they borrowed. The difference between the price at which they sold the shares and the price at which they later purchased the shares is their gain or loss. In essence, short selling is a strategy to sell high initially, and then later buy low. The investor is betting the stock will fall.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Short Position Example</div>
  <p><strong>Short Position:</strong> A customer who owns no stock places an order to sell short 100 shares of XYZ stock. Once the trade is executed, the customer is short 100 shares of XYZ stock. A short stock position is bearish, meaning that the customer believes the price of the stock to decline.</p>

### Size of Order

Orders may be classified by size. The following are some common examples:

- **Round lots:** Stock trades are typically done in round lots of 100 shares.
- **Odd lots:** An order for fewer than 100 shares (e.g., a trade for 40 shares). Small investors generally make odd lot trades. They are harder to fill and may involve a larger commission as a percentage of the cost of the trade.
- **Block orders:** Block orders are very large trades, usually over 10,000 shares, that are mostly placed by institutions and are often executed off market.

Different order types are used to specify either the timing or price of the order, or instructions on how the order is to be handled.

---

### Orders Based on Time

#### Day Order

A <span class="key-term">day order</span> is only good from the time it is placed until the end of the trading day of the exchange on which it trades. If it is not filled, the order will be canceled.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> All orders are assumed to be day orders unless specifically stated otherwise by the customer.</p>
</div>

#### Good 'til Canceled (GTC) Order

A <span class="key-term">good 'til canceled (GTC)</span> order persists until the broker cancels it. Some broker-dealers set a limit on a GTC order (e.g., 90 days), after which it will cancel automatically.

#### At the Open or At the Close Orders

At the open or at the close orders are required to be filled at, or as near as possible to, the price at the opening or closing of the market. These orders are sometimes referred to as <span class="key-term">market-on-open (MOO)</span> or <span class="key-term">market-on-close (MOC)</span> orders.

---

### Topic 2: Miscellaneous Order Types

#### Market-Not-Held Order

A <span class="key-term">market-not-held order</span> is turned over to a trader. The trader is given discretion to fill the order at whatever time and price the trader thinks best, but it must be completed that day. Market-not-held orders do not carry over to the next day.

#### Fill-or-Kill (FOK) Order

A <span class="key-term">fill-or-kill (FOK)</span> order instructs the trader to fill the entire order immediately. For instance, a customer wants to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ for $20 per share. The trader discovers that only 9,000 shares are available at that price. The entire order is canceled since no partial fills are permitted.

#### All-or-None (AON) Order

An <span class="key-term">all-or-none (AON)</span> order requires that the entire order be filled or else canceled. The order may be filled throughout the day since there is no requirement to execute the transaction immediately. For instance, a customer wants to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ for $20 per share. The trader discovers that only 5,000 shares are available at that price right now. The trader may continue to work the order for the balance of the day but is required to fill the order in its entirety. If all 10,000 shares cannot be purchased, the entire order is canceled.

#### Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) Order

An <span class="key-term">immediate-or-cancel (IOC)</span> order requires that any portion of the order is filled immediately, and the balance will be canceled. For instance, a customer wants to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ for $20 per share. The trader discovers that only 9,000 shares are available at that price. The 9,000 shares will be purchased, and the balance of the order (for the remaining 1,000 shares) is canceled.

## Section 3: Orders Based on Price

Orders can be specified to execute at the current market price, a minimum or maximum price, or at a price that triggers another type of order. Four types of orders are based on price. The prices of orders that are active at the time of a corporate action (e.g., dividend or split) are adjusted for that action.

### Why This Section Matters

Price-based orders give investors control over execution prices—but each type has trade-offs between price certainty and execution certainty. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for the exam and for client advice.

---

### Topic 1: Types of Orders

#### Market Order

A <span class="key-term">market order</span> is to be filled immediately at the prevailing market price. There is no price specified on the order. Market orders may not always be the best choice for thinly traded securities, where the difference between the quoted price for bids and offers can be large. Market orders will always be filled.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Buy limit orders are placed under the market price. Sell limit orders are placed above the market price.</p>
</div>

Limit orders specify a price at which to buy or sell. This order will be executed at that price or better. If a price better than the limit price is not available, the trade will not be executed at the limit price. However, the price of execution will never be worse than the limit price, so a customer can get a better price than expected.

After hours market prices are volatile, and spreads are typically very wide. For this reason, most after hours orders are entered with price limits.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Limit Order Examples</div>
  <p><strong>Buy Limit:</strong> A customer places a limit order to buy 100 shares of XYZ. If the limit was opened at 10.15 – 10.25 when the order is executed, the customer will receive 100 shares at a price of 10.25 or less. The order order will be filled.</p>
  <p><strong>Sell Limit:</strong> Limit orders specify a price at which to buy or sell. The order will be executed at that price or better. However, a limit order may not get filled.</p>
</div>

#### Stop Order

A <span class="key-term">stop order</span> acts as a trigger. If the market price rises or passes through the price specified on a stop order, the stop order turns into a market order and can be executed. Stop orders are also called <span class="key-term">stop-loss orders</span> because they can be used to close a position, ensuring that future losses are limited. Hence, the term stop loss.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Stop Order Examples</div>
  <p><strong>Buy Stop:</strong> A customer is short 100 shares of XYZ. They are worried that the stock price may start to rise. XYZ last traded at $40. If the price continues to rise and reaches $45 (2 above), the stop will trigger a market order to buy the stock at the next available price. This will close out the short position.</p>
  <p><strong>Sell Stop:</strong> A customer owns 1,000 shares of XYZ. They are worried that the stock price may start to fall. XYZ last traded at $40. If the price falls to $35 or below, the stop will trigger a market order to sell the stock. The shares will then be sold at the next available price.</p>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Stop orders are typically used to hedge a position, ensuring that future losses are limited. Hence, the term stop loss.</p>
</div>

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">SLOBS and BLUSS Memory Tool</div>
  <p>It can be difficult to remember which orders are placed either above or below the current market price. The following memory tool is useful to recall where each order is placed:</p>
  <p><strong>SLOBS:</strong> <u>S</u>ell <u>L</u>imit <u>O</u>ver the market <u>B</u>uy <u>S</u>top.</p>
  <p>Sell limit and buy stop (and buy stop limit) orders are placed at a price above the current market price.</p>
  <p><strong>BLUSS:</strong> <u>B</u>uy <u>L</u>imit <u>U</u>nder the market <u>S</u>ell <u>S</u>top.</p>
  <p>Buy limit and sell stop (and sell stop limit) orders are typically placed below the market price.</p>
</div>

#### Stop Limit Order

A <span class="key-term">stop limit order</span> turns into a limit order when a trigger price is reached. Two important prices: trigger price and limit price.

### Topic 2: Order Reductions

#### How Active Orders Are Affected by Corporate Actions

Another testable point is how active orders will be affected by a corporate action. When a cash dividend is paid, order prices that are below the market price (buy limits and sell stops) will be reduced. When a stock dividend or forward stock split is paid, the order size and price for all open positions will be adjusted to reflect the issuance of new stock and resulting changes in market price.

Order adjustments will be made on the <span class="key-term">ex-dividend date</span> (or <span class="key-term">ex-date</span>, the day on which a buyer would no longer qualify for a dividend, assuming regular way settlement; it is the same day as the record date) to reflect the dividend or the stock split. If an investor does not want the order affected, the order will be marked "do not reduce" (DNR) for the price and "do not increase" (DNI) for the number of shares.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> If a reverse split occurs, all orders (buy and sell) are canceled.</p>
</div>

#### What Language Suggests an Order?

Not all statements that show interest in a stock or bond are orders. A request for a quote would not be considered an order. Customers must firmly state whether they want to buy or sell. For example, a statement such as "I might want to sell shares of XYZ if the price goes down to 30" would not be an order. In contrast, a statement such as "Downsize my position on XYZ by 100 shares" would be considered an order because the customer is asking to sell 100 shares.
