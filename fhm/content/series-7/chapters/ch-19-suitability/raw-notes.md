## Section 1: Determining Suitability

### Introduction

- A key part of the Series 7 exam is its emphasis on client suitability
- The focus on the exam is twofold:
  1. Test your understanding of the rules and regulations regarding suitability
  2. Test your ability to make suitable recommendations to clients based on their investment profile

### Topic 1: Determining Suitability

#### Three Components of Suitability

- FINRA developed suitability requirements to protect the investing public, particularly retail
  investors
- The FINRA Suitability Rule requires 3 components:
  1. **Reasonable-basis suitability** — the firm and its associated persons must have a reasonable
     basis to believe that a recommendation is suitable for at least some investors. Requires due
     diligence and reasonable inquiry into the investment product itself.
  2. **Customer-specific suitability** — the firm and its associated persons must have a reasonable
     basis to believe that a recommendation is suitable for a particular customer. Must be based on
     the customer's investment profile including age, financial situation, tax status, investment
     objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, and risk
     tolerance.
  3. **Quantitative suitability** — a person who has actual or de facto control over a customer's
     account must have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of recommended transactions,
     even if individually suitable, are not excessive or unsuitable for the customer when taken
     together. Considers turnover rate, cost-equity ratio, and use of in-and-out trading.

#### Suitability Information

- A customer's financial situation is one of the most important factors in making a suitable
  recommendation
- Customer profile elements to consider:
  - Age
  - Tax status/bracket
  - Income
  - Net worth/financial resources
  - Financial needs
  - Investment experience
  - Risk tolerance
  - Investment objectives
  - Time horizon
  - Liquidity needs
  - Other investments held
  - Marital status
  - Number of dependents

#### Customer Investment Profiles

- A customer who has financial experience and/or is a market professional, is generally more suited
  to speculative, complex, and high-risk investments
- A customer who has limited to moderate investment knowledge is generally more suited to
  investments that are more conservative, less complex, and carry lower risk

#### Suitability: Customer-Specific Knowledge

- A person's (BD's) investment experience, age, net/gross income, tax bracket, and time horizon are
  generally more important than the customer's individual preferences
- Risk is the possibility that something bad (financially) could happen, such as the loss of money
  in an investment
- Customers have varying degrees of tolerance for risk, generally proportional to their overall
  investment knowledge and financial circumstances
- The risk tolerance of a customer with limited experience is, by default, lower than someone who
  has years of trading or investment knowledge
- Understanding the customer's risk tolerance, combined with the customer's objectives, is the key
  to recommending suitable investments

#### Customer Profiles Based on Risk Tolerance

- **Conservative** — generally have shorter time horizons; generally retired or near retirement;
  primarily concerned with preservation of capital and generating income; less tolerance for market
  fluctuations
- **Moderate** — willing to accept some risk for potential growth; balance between income and
  growth; may have a medium-length time horizon
- **Aggressive/Speculative** — willing to accept significant risk for potential higher returns;
  typically have longer time horizons; may be younger investors with higher income

#### Investment Objectives

- Each customer will have different investment objectives; it is important to understand the
  customer's objectives in order to recommend suitable investments
- **Growth** — focuses on capital appreciation; suitable for investors with longer time horizons;
  common stocks, growth mutual funds, growth ETFs
- **Income** — focuses on generating regular income; suitable for retirees or those needing cash
  flow; bonds, preferred stock, income-oriented funds, dividend-paying stocks
- **Capital preservation** — focuses on maintaining the value of the principal investment; suitable
  for risk-averse investors with short time horizons; money market funds, Treasury bills, CDs,
  short-term bonds
- **Speculation** — focuses on high returns with willingness to accept high risk; options, penny
  stocks, high-yield bonds, leveraged ETFs

#### Time Horizon

- Time horizon means the length of time an investor expects to hold an investment before needing the
  money
- **Short-term** (0-3 years) — money market instruments, CDs, short-term bonds
- **Medium-term** (3-10 years) — balanced funds, intermediate bonds, blue-chip stocks
- **Long-term** (10+ years) — growth stocks, equity funds, real estate

#### Liquidity Needs

- Liquidity refers to how quickly an investment can be converted to cash without significant loss of
  value
- High liquidity needs = money market funds, Treasury bills, savings accounts
- Low liquidity needs = real estate, limited partnerships, annuities (with surrender charges)

#### Risk Tolerance and Investment Profiles Table

  small cap stocks

#### Investment Objectives Table

| Objective               | Primary Focus             | Suitable Products                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Preservation of capital | Protect principal         | Money market, T-bills, CDs              |
| Income                  | Regular cash flow         | Bonds, preferred stock, dividend stocks |
| Growth                  | Capital appreciation      | Common stock, growth funds              |
| Speculation             | Maximum return, high risk | Options, penny stocks, leveraged ETFs   |

#### Prohibited Recommendations

- An investment might meet the criteria for reasonable-basis and customer-specific suitability, but
  if the frequency of transactions is excessive given the customer's profile, the recommendation
  fails quantitative suitability
- **Excessive trading (churning)** — making excessive trades in a customer's account primarily to
  generate commissions
- **Unauthorized trading** — making trades without the customer's prior authorization
- **Unsuitable recommendations** — recommending products that do not match the customer's investment
  profile

## Section 2: Suitability Scenarios

### Scenario 1

- **Customer**: Aged 55, investment portfolio totaling $3,000,000 at your firm, invested 30% in blue
  chip stocks, 30% in small stocks, and 40% in corporate bonds. Has just been promoted and has
  received a substantial pay raise. His marginal federal tax rate has risen from 28% to 37%. You
  believe that his investment mix is appropriate based on his investment objectives, experience, and
  risk tolerance. However, he is concerned about the impact of being in the highest tax bracket on
  his portfolio returns.
- **Best recommendation**: Liquidate the blue chip stocks and invest the proceeds in municipal bonds
- **Why**: Dividends received from corporate stocks get favored tax treatment (taxed at 0-20%
  depending on income). But in contrast, corporate bond interest is fully taxable at ordinary income
  tax rates. So liquidating the corporate bond holding and investing the proceeds in federally
  tax-free municipal bonds would produce a higher after-tax return for this client. The other reason
  not to liquidate the stock holding and invest in more bonds is that this customer is only 55 and
  it's probably wiser to keep 50-60% of his portfolio invested in stocks to produce higher returns
  over the long term. Also, selling the stock may result in capital gains taxes.

### Scenario 2

- **Customer**: Maria has just graduated from college with a double major in math and computer
  science. After accepting a job offer from a Silicon Valley company, she comes to you for advice
  about investing her $50,000 signing bonus. She says she wants to start saving for retirement, and
  her company offers a generous 401(k) plan. She currently has $20,000 in credit card debt and a
  checking account with a balance of $500. She wants to be quite thrifty and only needs $45,000 of
  income to live comfortably. He would like to invest the remaining $24,000 every year.
- **Best recommendation**: Open a Roth IRA and deposit the entire $60,000 ($50,000 signing bonus +
  savings)
- **Why**: Although Maria would like to start saving for retirement, she can do so in her company's
  401(k) plan. The first thing she needs to do is pay off her credit card debt, which at a secure
  rate carries a high interest rate. An immediate annuity is generally for retired investors seeking
  immediate income.

### Scenario 3

- **Customer**: Dawn is a 35-year-old investor. She has had an IRA for the past 10 years, and she
  has $45,000 in savings. She would like to add to her savings in the hope of purchasing a home
  within the next three years. She has some investment experience and is a moderately conservative
  investor.
- **Best recommendation**: Short-term AAA-rated corporate bonds
- **Why**: The cash savings are irrelevant to this question, which concerns her IRA. The corporate
  bonds would be suitable for her savings, but she needs growth to best fund her future retirement.
  Preferred stock is for income seekers, rather than those seeking growth. Penny stocks are too
  speculative for most retail investors, especially those who are moderately conservative.

### Scenario 4

- **Customer**: The Luxs are a couple in their early 40s. In addition to contributing to their
  401(k) plans at work, they have a taxable account with the following investments: $200,000 ABC
  Growth Fund, $100,000 XYZ Value Fund. In addition, they have two children, ages 8 and 10, and
  would like to save for their future college education.
- **Best recommendation**: Liquidate a portion of the funds and invest in an age-weighted 529 plan
- **Why**: The Luxs want to save for college. 529 plans are college savings plans sponsored by the
  state. The contribution amount is not deductible, but the account grows tax-deferred, and
  distributions are tax-free when used to pay for qualified college expenses. Withdrawing from a
  401(k) plan would be subject to taxes and penalties if withdrawal before age 59½. In addition,
  this money is invested for their retirement, not their children's education. There is no need to
  liquidate all their investment funds, which may generate capital gains taxes. It would seem
  unlikely the couple would need to invest all $300,000 for college expenses that will not be
  incurred for 8 to 14 years from now. Investing the money in Treasury securities would generate
  federally taxable interest and offer less opportunity for growth. Keeping all the money invested
  in taxable funds would not offer the benefit of tax-deferred investing that is available in a 529
  plan.

### Scenario 5

- **Customer**: A new customer of yours is 73 years old. He is drawing Social Security of $24,000
  per year, and he is still working at a supermarket earning $25,000 per year. He expects to be able
  to work for 5 more years. He owns a fully paid house worth $215,000 and has a savings account
  holding $55,000. He explains to you that he is quite thrifty and only needs $45,000 of income to
  live comfortably. He would like to invest the remaining $4,000 each year.
- **Best recommendation**: Contribute $4,000 each year to the existing savings account (answer is a
  — this is a difficult question)
- **Why**: Because the customer is still working, contributions can still be made to either a
  traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. However, since the customer is in a low tax bracket, there are not
  many tax savings from contributing to a traditional IRA. Also, traditional IRAs are subject to
  required minimum distributions (RMDs) that must be taken each year after reaching age 73. These
  distributions are taxable as ordinary income. Therefore, the investor could contribute money to a
  plan while also taking required minimum distributions. This is confusing. A Roth IRA is a
  non-tax-deductible contribution, but they are also not subject to RMDs. Distributions from Roth
  IRAs are tax-free. IRAs also offer the opportunity for tax-deferred growth, which should be
  greater than the return on a savings account. That said, he should not liquidate his savings
  account, and he does not currently need additional income from an immediate annuity. However, when
  he quits working, he may consider purchasing an immediate annuity. This is a difficult question,
  as there is a big problem looming in the future. He is living on $49,000/year, and will lose half
  his income when he quits working. His current savings will not last long. He needs to generate
  more income than can be provided by a traditional savings account. Therefore, the best answer
  choice is still c.

### Scenario 6

- **Customer**: George and Mark are a young couple who are about to get married. They currently live
  in a rental apartment, but they want to buy their first house in 5 years. They currently have
  $68,000 in a high-yield savings account. They have discretionary investable funds of $15,000 each
  year. They expect to pay $300,000 for their house, putting 20% down (down payment = $60,000) and
  getting a mortgage for the remaining $240,000.
- **Best recommendation**: Liquidate $20,000 of the savings account, invest the proceeds in an
  intermediate-term Treasury fund, and add $15,000 a year to the fund
- **Why**: This couple wants to save for a house purchase in 5 years, at which time they will need
  $60,000 down payment. A high-yield savings account is a suitable place to save money for a down
  payment in a pinch. If they add $15,000 a year to their savings, they will have $68,000 + (5 ×
  $15,000) = $143,000. A variable annuity is for retirement and would not meet their needs. Although
  an intermediate Treasury fund is relatively safe, it is subject to losses if interest rates rise.
  More importantly, investing $15,000 a year in a bond fund would result in a total investment of
  $75,000, which is much more than they need for their down payment. Keeping all their money in
  long-term growth funds would not be a suitable option.

### Scenario 7

- **Customer**: You have a new client who is 44 years old. He recently lost his long-time job at
  ACME Corporation, where he was earning $120,000 per year. He has a 401(k) account that he no
  longer wants to keep at his former company. The account is currently invested 80% in ACME stock
  and 50% in the ACME growth mutual fund, with a balance of $280,000. His investment objective is to
  accumulate a nest egg for retirement. The customer is single and has $60,000 in savings. His
  monthly living expenses total $6,000. He believes it will take about one year to find a new job.
- **Best recommendation**: Roll over the 401(k) to a traditional IRA and liquidate the ACME
  Corporation shares, keeping $60,000 of the proceeds in a money market fund and investing the
  balance in Class A shares of ABC Growth Fund
- **Why**: This client has three needs: growth for future retirement, an additional cash reserve in
  case his unemployment lasts longer than a year, and greater diversification. You hope he will
  choose to withdraw funds from his account since these withdrawals may be subject to a 10% penalty
  (since he is under age 59½) and will also be subject to ordinary income tax. Also, funds that he
  needs in the short-term should not be invested in equity securities. Liquidating the entire 401(k)
  would be the worst recommendation due to the enormous tax consequences, as well as losing the
  continued benefits of tax-deferred growth. The second choice is also a bad idea because it does
  not address his over-concentration in company stock. This lack of diversification makes his
  portfolio much riskier than it needs to be.
  - Answer c may look like a plausible alternative, but the red flag here is the recommendation to
    invest in Class C shares. Due to their fee structure, Class C shares are generally not suitable
    for long-term retirement investing.
