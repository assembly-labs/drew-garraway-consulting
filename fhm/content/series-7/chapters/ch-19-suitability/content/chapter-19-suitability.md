# Chapter 19: Suitability

*Series 7 Exam Weight: Suitability concepts appear throughout the exam (~11-14% overall)*

---

In 1999, a 72-year-old widow walked into a brokerage office with $800,000 in life insurance proceeds—every dollar she had in the world. Her broker put her into speculative technology stocks. Within two years, she'd lost nearly everything. The case became one of the most cited FINRA arbitration examples in suitability law. The broker's defense? "She said she wanted growth." The arbitration panel was unconvinced.

The Series 7 exam doesn't just test whether you know what a municipal bond is. It tests whether you know *who* should own one. Suitability—matching the right investment to the right client—is arguably the most important concept on the entire exam, because it's the concept that protects real people from real harm.

### Why This Chapter Matters

FINRA's suitability framework is the backbone of every recommendation you'll ever make as a registered representative. The exam tests it two ways: first, your understanding of the rules themselves, and second, your ability to apply them in scenario-based questions. This chapter covers both.

## Section 1: Determining Suitability

### The FINRA Suitability Rule: Three Components

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p>FINRA requires three layers of suitability analysis for every recommendation:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Reasonable-basis suitability</strong> — The investment must be suitable for <em>at least some investors</em>. The firm must perform due diligence on the product itself before recommending it to anyone.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Customer-specific suitability</strong> — The investment must be suitable for <em>this particular customer</em>, based on their investment profile: age, financial situation, tax status, objectives, experience, time horizon, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Quantitative suitability</strong> — Even if each individual trade is suitable, the <em>series of transactions</em> must not be excessive when taken together. This applies to anyone with actual or de facto control over an account. Considers turnover rate, cost-equity ratio, and in-and-out trading patterns.</p>
</div>

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>FINRA's suitability framework evolved from decades of enforcement actions. The three-component structure was formalized in FINRA Rule 2111, which replaced the older NASD suitability rule in 2012. Quantitative suitability—the newest addition—was specifically designed to address churning, where a broker makes excessive trades to generate commissions, even when each individual trade might pass muster on its own.</p>
</div>

### The Customer Investment Profile

A customer's financial situation is one of the most important factors in making a suitable recommendation. Before recommending anything, you need to understand who you're talking to. FINRA requires consideration of these factors:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Customer Profile Elements</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>Determines time horizon and risk capacity</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Income</strong></td><td>Affects ability to absorb losses and contribute</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Net worth</strong></td><td>Overall financial cushion</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Tax status/bracket</strong></td><td>Drives tax-advantaged product selection</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Investment experience</strong></td><td>Determines complexity tolerance</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Investment objectives</strong></td><td>Growth, income, preservation, speculation</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Time horizon</strong></td><td>Short, medium, or long-term needs</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Liquidity needs</strong></td><td>How quickly they may need cash</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Risk tolerance</strong></td><td>Willingness and ability to accept loss</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Other investments</strong></td><td>Existing portfolio and diversification</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Marital status / dependents</strong></td><td>Financial obligations and planning needs</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> On the exam, a customer's investment experience, age, income, tax bracket, and time horizon generally carry more weight than stated preferences. If a 75-year-old retiree says they want "aggressive growth," the right answer is still conservative—you know their profile better than their wishes.</p>
</div>

---

### Experience and Complexity

A customer who has financial experience and/or is a market professional is generally more suited to speculative, complex, and high-risk investments. Conversely, a customer with limited to moderate investment knowledge should be directed toward more conservative, less complex, and lower-risk options.

### Risk Tolerance

<span class="key-term">Risk</span> is the possibility that something bad could happen financially—specifically, the loss of money in an investment. <span class="key-term">Risk tolerance</span> is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing and able to withstand. It's shaped by both emotional comfort and financial circumstances.

Customers have varying degrees of tolerance for risk, generally proportional to their overall investment knowledge and financial circumstances. A customer with limited investment experience has, by default, a lower risk tolerance than someone with years of trading knowledge. Understanding risk tolerance—combined with the customer's objectives—is the key to making suitable recommendations.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Risk Tolerance and Investment Profiles</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Profile</th><th>Typical Customer</th><th>Goals</th><th>Risk Level</th><th>Suitable Products</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Conservative</strong></td><td>Retirees, near-retirees (shorter time horizons)</td><td>Preservation, income</td><td>Low</td><td>Gov't bonds, money market, CDs, high-grade corporates, blue-chip dividend stocks</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Moderate</strong></td><td>Mid-career professionals</td><td>Growth and income</td><td>Medium</td><td>Blue-chip stocks, balanced funds, investment-grade bonds, index funds</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Aggressive</strong></td><td>Young professionals, high-income</td><td>Capital appreciation, speculation</td><td>High</td><td>Growth stocks, sector funds, options, high-yield bonds, small caps, leveraged products</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

---

### Investment Objectives

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Objective</th><th>Primary Focus</th><th>Suitable Products</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Preservation of capital</strong></td><td>Protect principal</td><td>Money market, T-bills, CDs, short-term bonds</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Income</strong></td><td>Regular cash flow</td><td>Bonds, preferred stock, dividend stocks, income funds</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Growth</strong></td><td>Capital appreciation</td><td>Common stock, growth funds, equity ETFs</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Speculation</strong></td><td>Maximum return (high risk)</td><td>Options, penny stocks, leveraged ETFs, high-yield bonds</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

These objectives are not mutually exclusive—many investors seek a combination of growth and income, for example. But the exam tends to test clear-cut scenarios where one objective dominates.

---

### Time Horizon

<span class="key-term">Time horizon</span> is how long the investor expects to hold an investment before needing the money. It directly affects which products are appropriate:

- **Short-term (0-3 years)** — Money market instruments, CDs, short-term bonds. Capital preservation is paramount.
- **Medium-term (3-10 years)** — Balanced funds, intermediate bonds, blue-chip stocks. Some growth potential with moderate risk.
- **Long-term (10+ years)** — Growth stocks, equity funds, real estate. Time to recover from market downturns.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> When the exam gives you a time horizon, match it to the investment. A client saving for a house down payment in 2 years shouldn't be in growth stocks. A 30-year-old saving for retirement shouldn't be in money market funds.</p>
</div>

---

### Liquidity Needs

<span class="key-term">Liquidity</span> refers to how quickly an investment can be converted to cash without significant loss of value.

- **High liquidity needs** — Money market funds, Treasury bills, savings accounts
- **Low liquidity needs** — Real estate, limited partnerships, annuities (which may carry surrender charges)

Clients who may need access to their money on short notice should not be placed in illiquid investments, regardless of the potential return.

---

### Prohibited Practices

Even when individual recommendations appear suitable, certain patterns of behavior are always prohibited:

- <span class="key-term">Excessive trading (churning)</span> — Making trades primarily to generate commissions, not to benefit the client. This is what quantitative suitability is designed to catch.
- <span class="key-term">Unauthorized trading</span> — Executing transactions without the customer's prior authorization.
- <span class="key-term">Unsuitable recommendations</span> — Recommending products that do not match the customer's investment profile, regardless of the product's merits.

## Section 2: Suitability Scenarios

The Series 7 exam will present scenario-based questions that describe a customer's profile and ask which investment would be most or least suitable. These questions can appear to be subjective, but there is always a "best" answer given the information provided.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Since the question stems can be lengthy, an effective strategy is to look at the four answer choices first, then read the question stem for the appropriate information. If you are stuck between two close answer choices? As always, your first choice is often the best choice, as long as you think like a regulator. Regulators tend to help consumers stick to their investment goals and often lean toward safety vs. the chance of achieving outsized returns.</p>
</div>

### Scenario Principles (From Course Examples)

These principles emerged from the course's seven practice scenarios:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Key Suitability Principles From Scenarios</div>
  <p><strong>1. Tax-sensitive rebalancing:</strong> When a high-income client moves into a higher tax bracket, consider shifting <em>bond holdings</em> (not stocks) into municipal bonds. Corporate bond interest is taxed as ordinary income; stock dividends get preferential rates. Don't sell stocks just to buy munis.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Debt first:</strong> A young investor with credit card debt should pay off high-interest debt before investing. High-interest debt effectively earns a guaranteed "return" equal to the interest rate saved.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Match the account to the goal:</strong> College savings → 529 plan (tax-deferred growth, tax-free distributions for qualified expenses). Retirement → IRA or 401(k). Near-term purchase → savings or short-term bonds.</p>
  <p><strong>4. 529 plans for education:</strong> Contributions to 529 plans are not tax-deductible, but earnings grow tax-deferred and distributions are tax-free for qualified education expenses. Don't raid retirement accounts for education funding.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Roth IRA advantages for low-bracket taxpayers:</strong> Roth IRAs are non-deductible but not subject to RMDs, and qualified distributions are tax-free. For low-bracket investors, the Roth often makes more sense than a traditional IRA.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Time horizon drives vehicle choice:</strong> 5-year goal = intermediate-term bonds or savings, not variable annuities or long-term growth funds. Match the maturity of the investment to the time frame of the goal.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Diversification and concentration risk:</strong> An investor with 80% of their 401(k) in company stock has dangerous concentration risk. The first priority when rolling over is to diversify. Also: Class C shares (with higher ongoing expenses) are generally unsuitable for long-term retirement investing—Class A shares (with upfront sales charges but lower ongoing fees) are typically more appropriate for long holding periods.</p>
</div>

(The suitability scenarios on the exam tend to reward the answer that thinks like a regulator—conservative, diversified, tax-aware, and always matching the investment to the client's actual situation rather than their most optimistic hopes.)
