# Chapter 11: Individual Customer Accounts

_Series 7 Exam Weight: ~11% of exam (~14 questions)_

---

On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act into law, just 45 days
after the September 11 attacks. Buried inside its 342 pages were provisions that would permanently
transform how brokerage firms open accounts. Before that day, opening a brokerage account was
roughly as complicated as getting a library card. After it, every new account became a small-scale
federal investigation--verifying identity, checking terrorist watchlists, and documenting the source
of funds. The financial industry, which had previously treated account opening as a sales formality,
suddenly found itself on the front lines of national security.

This chapter covers everything that happens before and after a customer places their first trade:
the paperwork, the identity checks, the privacy rules, the suitability analysis, and the ongoing
maintenance that keeps an account running properly. It's not the most glamorous material on the
Series 7, but it shows up in roughly 14 questions--and getting these wrong means you don't
understand the regulatory framework that every other chapter builds upon.

### Why This Chapter Matters

Every recommendation you'll ever make, every trade you'll ever execute, and every dispute you'll
ever face traces back to how the account was opened. The new account form isn't just paperwork--it's
the legal foundation that determines what's suitable, what's authorized, and who's responsible when
things go wrong.

---

## Section 1: Customer Accounts for Individuals

Before opening a new account, a registered representative (RR) is required to gather and record a
significant amount of information. This information serves three purposes: establishing the
customer's identity, determining suitability for future recommendations, and fulfilling anti-money
laundering requirements.

---

### Topic 1: The New Account Form

#### Required Information

FINRA requires specific information for every new customer account. Here's what must be on the form:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Required on every new account form:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer name and address</li>
    <li>Whether the customer is of legal age (note: date of birth is not initially required to <em>open</em> the account, though it will be needed for identity verification)</li>
    <li>Name of the registered representative(s) who will handle the account (not required for institutional accounts)</li>
    <li>A principal's signature approving the account</li>
    <li>The representative's signature, if the representative completed the suitability determination (not required if the client submitted online)</li>
    <li>If the customer is a corporation, the name of the person authorized to transact business in the account</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Two things you do NOT need on the new account form: the customer's signature and the customer's educational background. The principal signs, not the customer. This trips people up on the exam every time.</p>
</div>

#### Reasonable Efforts for Non-Mutual Fund Accounts

If the account is for an individual who isn't simply purchasing unsolicited mutual funds, the broker
must make <span class="key-term">reasonable efforts</span> to obtain the following information
before the settlement of the first transaction:

- Social Security number or tax identification number (this must be provided to verify identity)
- Occupation of customer and address of employer
- Whether the customer is employed by a bank or broker-dealer
- Whether the customer is an officer or director of a publicly held company
- Citizenship
- Whether it's a cash or margin account
- Third-party authorization (if any)

#### Suitability Information

For suitability purposes, a reasonable effort must also be made to obtain:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Suitability Data Points</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Age (date of birth)</strong></td><td>Required for identity verification; determines time horizon and risk capacity</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Investment experience</strong></td><td>Shapes product complexity tolerance</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Investment time horizon and liquidity needs</strong></td><td>Drives product maturity and lock-up appropriateness</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Risk tolerance</strong></td><td>Governs aggressiveness of recommendations</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Financial situation and needs</strong></td><td>Overall capacity to absorb loss</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Investment objectives and other holdings</strong></td><td>Determines diversification and goal alignment</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Estimated annual income</strong></td><td>Affects ability to invest and withstand losses</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Tax status</strong></td><td>Drives tax-advantaged product selection</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Copy of the New Account Form

Timing matters. A copy of the new account form must be sent to the customer:

- **Within 30 days** of opening the account
- **At least every 3 years** thereafter, to verify and update the customer's information
- **Within 30 days** of any updates

Customer records must be maintained for at least <span class="key-term">6 years</span> after the
information was last updated and for at least 6 years after the account is closed.

#### The Predispute Arbitration Agreement

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Arbitration became the standard dispute resolution mechanism in the securities industry because lawsuits were expensive, unpredictable, and slow. The industry discovered that mandatory arbitration was a more cost-effective and expedited way to resolve disputes--and it also kept embarrassing details out of public court records. Today, virtually every firm requires a predispute arbitration agreement before opening an account, even though no FINRA or SEC rule mandates it.</p>
</div>

Here's the key distinction: it is **not mandatory** that a customer sign an arbitration agreement.
No FINRA or SEC rule requires it. However, virtually every firm requires one as a condition of
opening the account. In practice, if you want to open the account, you're signing the agreement.

Most new account forms contain a <span class="key-term">predispute arbitration agreement</span>, in
which the customer agrees to resolve disputes with the firm or its associated persons through
arbitration rather than litigation.

#### Predispute Arbitration Agreement Disclosures

If a firm includes a predispute arbitration agreement, FINRA requires it to be highlighted and
include language explaining that:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Required arbitration disclosures:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The customer is giving up their right to sue in court</li>
    <li>Arbitration is final and binding</li>
    <li>Arbitrators do not have to explain the reasons for their award</li>
    <li>Arbitration panels include a minority of individuals who were, or are, affiliated with the securities industry</li>
  </ul>
</div>

---

### Topic 2: Customer Identification and Verification

#### The USA PATRIOT Act

The <span class="key-term">USA PATRIOT Act</span> requires member firms to independently verify a
customer's identity using four pieces of information:

1. **Name**
2. **Address**
3. **Date of birth**
4. **Social Security number or tax ID number**

Verification can be done with a government-issued photo ID:

- A current driver's license
- A passport
- An alien registration card
- A green card
- Another government-issued identification

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> A Social Security card is NOT acceptable for identity verification under the PATRIOT Act--it doesn't have a photo. The exam loves testing this distinction.</p>
</div>

Verification must be completed within a reasonable amount of time after the account is opened.

#### Customer Identification Program (CIP)

Beyond verifying identity, firms must also check whether the customer appears on a known or
suspected terrorist list. Specifically, they must screen against the
<span class="key-term">Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list</span>,
maintained by the <span class="key-term">Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)</span>.

These rules exist to detect and deter money laundering and the funding of terrorist organizations.
Records relating to identification verification must be kept for at least **5 years**.

#### Know Your Customer (KYC)

The <span class="key-term">Know Your Customer (KYC)</span> rule requires broker-dealers to use
"reasonable diligence" in collecting and maintaining essential information on their customers. The
rule requires firms to check:

- Customers' identities
- Investment histories
- Investment objectives
- Sources of funds

This information serves two purposes: ensuring customers aren't engaging in money laundering, and
making suitable recommendations.

**What if the customer doesn't provide everything?** The account may still be opened if the firm
collects certain essential facts necessary to:

- Effectively service a customer's account
- Carry out special handling instructions for the account
- Understand who has trading authority on the account
- Comply with securities laws, regulations, and rules

When information is missing, a supervisor must be informed. Inquiries should be made and documented
as to why the missing information wasn't provided. The supervisor must ensure that no missing
information constitutes an essential fact.

#### KYC Updates

The KYC rule requires firms to make regular contact with customers to check if investment objectives
or essential facts have changed. While the SEC requires broker-dealers to update suitability
information at least every **3 years**, the KYC obligation may require more frequent updates
depending on the circumstances.

#### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Requirements

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Anti-money laundering rules were first codified under the <span class="key-term">Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</span> in 1970, originally targeting banks. After September 11, 2001, the PATRIOT Act extended these requirements to brokerage firms and other financial institutions. The government recognized that terrorists were exploiting the financial system, and that broker-dealers--with their ability to move money quickly across borders through securities transactions--were just as vulnerable as banks.</p>
</div>

#### The Three Phases of Money Laundering

Understanding how criminals launder money helps you understand why the rules exist:

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Money laundering has three phases:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Placement</strong> — The initial entry of illicit cash into the financial system. Often done by making cash deposits below reporting thresholds, purchasing gambling chips, or mixing dirty money with legitimate business cash.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Layering</strong> — Once deposited, funds are wired through a series of financial institutions, making them difficult to trace back to their source. This is where the "laundering" really happens.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Integration</strong> — The final stage, where funds are returned to the criminal from what appear to be legitimate sources. The money is now "clean."</p>
</div>

Think of it as: get the cash in (placement), move it around until nobody can follow the trail
(layering), then pull it back out looking legitimate (integration).

#### Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)

The BSA requires financial institutions to report currency transactions--deposits or withdrawals of
cash--that exceed <span class="key-term">$10,000</span>. When this threshold is crossed, the
institution must file a <span class="key-term">Currency Transaction Report (CTR)</span> with
<span class="key-term">FinCEN</span> (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) within **15 days**.

#### Structuring

<span class="key-term">Structuring</span> is the practice of making a series of smaller deposits or
withdrawals to avoid triggering the $10,000 CTR threshold. It's illegal, and firms are trained to
spot it.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <p>An individual deposits $4,000 in cash at 8:00 a.m., another $4,000 at 1:00 p.m., and another $4,000 at 3:00 p.m. Even though no single deposit exceeds $10,000, the combined total for the day does--triggering a CTR filing. And if an individual makes repeated deposits under $10,000 over several days, weeks, or even months, and the representative believes this is being done intentionally to avoid reporting, that's still structuring.</p>
</div>

If the $10,000 limit is exceeded AND the firm suspects illegal activity, both an SAR and a CTR must
be filed.

#### Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)

The BSA requires broker-dealers to file <span class="key-term">Suspicious Activity Reports
(SARs)</span> with FinCEN--part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury--which serves as the central
collection point for these reports.

Key SAR facts:

- If potential money laundering or BSA violations are detected or suspected, **for any dollar
  amount**, a report must be filed within **30 days**
- Beginning 1/1/2026, firms must notify FinCEN regarding the <span class="key-term">Beneficial
  Ownership Information (BOI)</span> of each account held by the firm in street name

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The Bank Secrecy Act <strong>forbids</strong> anyone who files a Suspicious Activity Report from notifying any person involved in the suspected activity that an SAR has been filed. This is sometimes called the "tipping off" prohibition. If the exam asks whether a firm should inform a customer that an SAR was filed, the answer is always NO.</p>
</div>

#### Monetary Instrument Log (MIL)

Broker-dealers must record cash purchases of negotiable instruments--personal checks, money orders,
travelers' checks--between <span class="key-term">$3,000 and $10,000</span> in an internal log
called a <span class="key-term">Monetary Instrument Log (MIL)</span>.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> MIL documents must be kept for 5 years. The exam likes to test the various retention periods: MIL = 5 years, CIP records = 5 years, customer records = 6 years.</p>
</div>

#### The Firm's AML Program

Every firm must establish an <span class="key-term">anti-money laundering (AML) program</span> with
the following components:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">AML Program Requirements</div>
  <ul>
    <li>A designated <strong>AML compliance officer</strong> responsible for creating written supervisory procedures</li>
    <li>Procedures reasonably designed to <strong>detect and report suspicious activity</strong></li>
    <li>A risk-based <strong>customer identification program (CIP)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Independent testing</strong> of the program at least annually</li>
    <li><strong>Ongoing training</strong> for appropriate personnel</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Numbered Accounts

Customers are permitted to open a <span class="key-term">numbered account</span>, using a number or
symbol instead of their name so they can remain anonymous when placing trades. But anonymity from
other traders doesn't mean anonymity from the firm--the customer's identity must still appear on the
new account form, and the owner must sign the form. This document is kept on file at the
broker-dealer.

Customers may also open multiple individual accounts at a single broker-dealer, but they must sign a
statement affirming that the accounts are not held for any other individual.

---

### Topic 3: Regulation S-P (Privacy of Customer Information)

#### The Privacy Framework

<span class="key-term">Regulation S-P (Reg S-P)</span> limits the ability of broker-dealers,
investment companies, and investment advisers to disclose <span class="key-term">personally
identifiable information (PII)</span> about their customers to nonaffiliated third parties.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The exam may refer to personally identifiable information as "PII." Know this acronym.</p>
</div>

#### Privacy Notice Requirements

Firms must provide customers with a notice describing their privacy policies and procedures:

- **When the account is opened**, and **annually thereafter**
- The notice must describe the type of information collected, how it will be used, and the
  categories of entities with whom it will be shared

#### Consumers vs. Customers

Reg S-P draws an important distinction between <span class="key-term">consumers</span> and
<span class="key-term">customers</span>:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Consumer vs. Customer Under Reg S-P</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th></th><th>Consumer</th><th>Customer</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Definition</strong></td><td>Provides information to a firm but does NOT have an ongoing relationship</td><td>Has an ongoing relationship with the firm</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Example</strong></td><td>An individual who completes an application but then withdraws it</td><td>An individual with an active account</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Privacy Notice</strong></td><td>Initial notice required only if the firm wants to disclose their information</td><td>Initial AND annual notice required</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Opt-Out Provision</strong></td><td>Required if the firm wants to disclose information</td><td>Required</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

Both consumers and customers must be given adequate notice and the opportunity to
<span class="key-term">opt out</span> of sharing personal information with third parties.

#### Written Safeguarding Plan

Reg S-P requires firms to maintain a written plan for safeguarding customer information. The plan
must be designed to:

- Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information
- Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to customer records
- Protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer records
- Properly dispose of personal information and protect against unauthorized access to disposed
  information

Firms must also conduct periodic reviews to detect potential problems in their databases.

---

### Topic 4: Trading Authorizations and Discretionary Accounts

#### Account Ownership

An individual account has only one owner. A representative may not give account information to
anyone else--including the account owner's spouse. The owner is the only person who can trade in the
account unless trading authorization has been explicitly granted.

#### Three Types of Trading Authorization

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>1. Limited trading authority</strong> — A third party can trade in the account, but CANNOT make withdrawals.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Full trading authority</strong> — A third party can trade AND make withdrawals.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Discretionary authority</strong> — Gives the registered representative authority to trade in the account on the customer's behalf.</p>
</div>

#### The AAA Rule: When You Don't Have Discretion

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p>Without discretionary authority, a representative needs <strong>three pieces of information</strong> from the customer to execute any transaction. Remember <strong>AAA</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A</strong>sset — the name of the security</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong>ction — whether to buy or sell</li>
    <li><strong>A</strong>mount — the quantity of the security to be traded</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the customer provides all three, the representative does not need discretionary authority--even if the customer leaves the timing and price to the rep's judgment.</p>
</div>

In most cases, discretionary authority is NOT required to exercise <span class="key-term">discretion
over time and price</span>. This means the broker-dealer may wait for the best time or price at
which to execute a customer order, as long as it is executed on the same day the customer places it.

#### Discretionary Accounts

Discretionary authority must be given **in writing** before the account can be opened. A
discretionary account typically requires the customer to grant their representative a
<span class="key-term">power of attorney (POA)</span>. In most cases, the POA grants limited trading
authorization (to trade), not full authorization (to make withdrawals).

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Even with a power of attorney, a registered representative CANNOT sign documents for a customer. The POA authorizes trading, not document execution. The exam tests this regularly.</p>
</div>

#### Churning in Discretionary Accounts

<span class="key-term">Churning</span> is the entering of excessive, often unsuitable transactions
to generate commissions for the representative. It's a major concern in discretionary accounts
because the representative has the power to trade without asking permission each time.

To guard against churning:

- A principal must **approve all discretionary accounts** before they are opened
- A principal must **promptly approve all discretionary orders** in writing
- A principal must **review all discretionary accounts at frequent intervals**

---

### Topic 5: Accounts for Employees of Other Firms and FINRA Employees

#### Accounts for Employees of Other Member Firms

FINRA and the MSRB have similar rules for opening an account for an associated person of another
member firm. The logic is straightforward: your employer needs to know what you're doing with your
personal investments, because conflicts of interest don't announce themselves.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Three steps for opening an account for an employee of another firm:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Written notice to the executing firm</strong> — The associated person must notify the firm where the account will be opened that they are an associated person of another member firm.</li>
    <li><strong>Written consent from the employer</strong> — The associated person must have written consent from their employing firm.</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate confirmations and statements on request</strong> — The executing firm must send duplicate trade confirmations and statements to the employer upon written request.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The MSRB's version of this rule is slightly stricter: it requires firms to send duplicate confirmations and statements <em>without</em> a written request. FINRA only requires them upon request.</p>
</div>

This rule applies broadly:

- All employees of broker-dealers who open accounts at other member firms
- Employees who open accounts at non-member financial institutions such as banks, trust companies,
  and investment advisers

#### Related and Other Persons

The rule extends beyond just the employee. It also applies to accounts held by:

- The spouse of the associated person
- A child who lives in the same household or is financially dependent upon the associated person
- Any other related individual over whose account the associated person has control
- Any other individual the associated person controls and provides financial support to

All such accounts must be disclosed to the representative's employing broker-dealer.

**Exception:** The rule does not apply to accounts limited to investment company securities or
municipal fund securities (such as 529 plans).

#### Restrictions on FINRA Employees

FINRA has specific rules for its own employees who want brokerage accounts. The self-regulatory
organization polices the industry, so its employees face additional restrictions:

- Cannot have a debt or equity interest in broker-dealers, or companies with broker-dealer
  subsidiaries that contribute 10% or more of the parent's revenue
- Cannot take options positions on these firms
- Cannot purchase stock in an IPO
- Must disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts they own or control
- Must authorize their broker-dealer to send duplicate statements to FINRA

(You can appreciate the irony: the regulators regulate themselves more strictly than they regulate
anyone else. At least on paper.)

## Section 2: Suitability and Account Maintenance

One of the primary reasons for collecting all that new account information is to ensure that future
recommendations will be suitable for a particular customer. All regulators--FINRA, the MSRB, and the
SEC--have established suitability standards. And as with all regulations, the SEC has the final say.
<span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</span> is the ultimate standard for client
suitability.

---

### Topic 1: FINRA and MSRB Suitability Requirements

#### Suitability Information Collection

FINRA requires firms to evaluate whether each recommendation is suitable for the customer. This
means collecting information on:

- Customer's age
- Time horizon (length of investment time)
- Liquidity needs
- Risk tolerance
- Tax status
- Current and future financial needs
- Investment experience

A suitability questionnaire should be provided at account opening and kept in the customer's file.
Firms must make reasonable efforts to collect and maintain this information. The questionnaire
should be revisited and updated frequently--at least every **36 months**.

#### Three Components of Suitability

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Three layers of suitability (also covered in Chapter 19):</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Reasonable-basis obligation</strong> — The firm and rep must understand the complexity and risks of a security or strategy, and determine whether it is suitable for at least <em>some</em> investors. Think of this as product-level due diligence.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Customer-specific obligation</strong> — A broker-dealer must believe that a recommendation is suitable for <em>this particular customer</em>, based on their personal and investment profile.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Quantitative suitability obligation</strong> — A broker-dealer must believe that a series of recommended transactions is not excessive. Even if each trade is individually suitable, the pattern as a whole must make sense.</p>
</div>

A suitability analysis must be conducted before a representative can make any recommendations.
However, a representative **may accept unsolicited orders** from a customer who has not provided
suitability information.

#### Institutional Customers Exception

Broker-dealers are not subject to the same strict suitability rules for
<span class="key-term">institutional customers</span>. An institutional customer is:

- A bank, savings and loan association, or insurance company
- A registered investment company
- A registered investment adviser
- An individual with total assets of **at least $50 million**

If the firm believes an institutional customer can evaluate risk independently, and the customer has
stated that it is acting independently, the broker-dealer has met its suitability requirements.

#### Municipal Securities Suitability (MSRB)

The MSRB suitability rule mirrors FINRA's and the SEC's, with a few additions:

- Firms must determine tax status by asking the customer for their **tax bracket** and **state of
  residence**
- If a customer refuses to disclose their financial status, **no recommendations can be made** (but
  unsolicited trades can still be accepted)
- If the representative believes an unsolicited trade is unsuitable, the customer must be informed.
  If the customer insists, the unsolicited order can then be entered

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Although not expressly prohibited, municipal securities are generally NOT suitable for tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs. Why? Because munis already provide tax-exempt income. Putting tax-exempt income inside a tax-deferred wrapper adds no benefit--and you lose the tax exemption on withdrawal. The exam tests this frequently.</p>
</div>

#### Suitability by Type of Investor

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Matching Investments to Investor Profiles</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Investor Type</th><th>Suitable Investments</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Older investors</strong> (at or near retirement)</td><td>U.S. Treasuries, Treasury bond funds and ETFs, highly rated corporate bond funds and ETFs, high-paying "blue-chip" dividend stocks, dividend funds and ETFs, bank CDs, immediate annuities</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>High-income tax bracket</strong></td><td>Municipal securities, investments with deferred income (private placements, limited partnerships, DPPs), tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, 529 accounts)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Long-term investors</strong></td><td>Equities, equity index mutual funds and equity index ETFs, balanced funds, real estate, annuities, tax-advantaged accounts, REITs, buy-and-hold strategies</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Topic 2: Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)

#### Overview

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Before Reg BI was adopted in June 2019, broker-dealers were held only to a suitability standard--meaning a recommendation just had to be "suitable" for the customer, even if a better or cheaper alternative existed. Investment advisers, meanwhile, were held to a fiduciary standard requiring them to act in their clients' best interest at all times. Reg BI was the SEC's attempt to close that gap for broker-dealers without going all the way to a full fiduciary duty. Whether it succeeded is still debated, but for exam purposes, Reg BI is the highest standard that applies to broker-dealer recommendations.</p>
</div>

The SEC's <span class="key-term">Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)</span> provides standards that
exceed traditional suitability requirements. Reg BI requires broker-dealers and their associated
persons to act in their <span class="key-term">retail customers' best interest</span>. The firm
cannot place its own financial interests ahead of its customers'. Firms must also identify,
eliminate, or disclose and mitigate any conflicts of interest between the firm and its retail
customers.

#### Retail Customer Definition

A customer is considered a <span class="key-term">retail customer</span> under Reg BI if all of the
following are true:

- The customer is a **natural person** (not a corporation) or a natural person's legal
  representative (such as a trustee or executor)
- The customer receives a recommendation from a broker-dealer about securities or an investment
  strategy involving securities
- The customer uses the recommendation primarily for **personal investing** (or that of their family
  or household)

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Accredited investors are NOT excluded from Reg BI protections. Even wealthy, sophisticated investors are covered when receiving recommendations from broker-dealers. Likewise, Reg BI applies to recommendations about private placements, OTC trades, and any other securities transaction or strategy.</p>
</div>

#### What Counts as a "Recommendation" Under Reg BI?

Reg BI applies broadly to recommendations made across all account types--margin accounts, retirement
accounts, and education savings accounts.

Recommendations covered include:

- What type of account to open (e.g., traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA)
- Rollovers or transfers from one account to another
- Any <span class="key-term">call to action</span>--statements that suggest a specific course of
  action

What is NOT a recommendation:

- Simply discussing investment options
- Providing general information (such as annual contribution limits for retirement accounts)

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Customers CANNOT waive Reg BI's protections under any circumstances. If the exam asks whether a client can sign away their Reg BI rights, the answer is always no.</p>
</div>

#### The Four Obligations of Reg BI

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Reg BI imposes four obligations on broker-dealers:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The Disclosure Obligation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The Care Obligation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The Conflict-of-Interest Obligation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The Compliance Obligation</strong></li>
  </ol>
</div>

#### 1. The Disclosure Obligation

Before or at the time of making a recommendation, firms must provide **full and fair written
disclosure** of the following material facts:

- That the firm is acting in a **broker-dealer capacity**
- Material **fees and costs**
- **Type and scope of services** provided
- Any material **limitations** on the securities or strategies that may be recommended
- All material facts relating to **conflicts of interest** associated with a recommendation (e.g.,
  proprietary products, third-party payments, compensation arrangements)

#### 2. The Care Obligation

The SEC defines three components of the care obligation that closely mirror FINRA's suitability
framework:

- **Reasonable-basis**: The firm must understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated
  with a recommendation
- **Customer-specific**: The firm must consider risks, rewards, and costs in the context of the
  customer's investment profile. Recommendations must be in the customer's best interest and cannot
  prioritize the firm's interests. Reasonable alternatives should be considered
- **Quantitative**: The firm cannot recommend a series of transactions that are excessive--even if
  each transaction is individually sound. A representative may not recommend multiple transactions
  simply to earn higher fees

#### 3. The Conflict-of-Interest Obligation

Broker-dealers must establish, maintain, and enforce procedures to address conflicts of interest:

- **Identify and mitigate** conflicts that might create incentives to put the firm's interests ahead
  of the customer's
- **Identify and disclose** material limitations on offerings (e.g., only offering proprietary
  funds) and prevent those limitations from disadvantaging customers
- **Identify and eliminate** sales contests, sales quotas, bonuses, and noncash compensation based
  on the sale of **specific securities** (e.g., a sales contest for mutual funds from a particular
  company)

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">The Contest Distinction</div>
  <p>A sales contest rewarding the top seller of "ABC Fund Company mutual funds" must be eliminated--it creates an incentive to push a specific product. But a contest rewarding the top seller of "all mutual funds" across all sponsors is permissible, because it's based on a general category, not a specific security.</p>
  <p>Similarly, some hiring bonuses take the form of forgivable loans that must be repaid if a new hire fails to meet performance goals. Whether such a loan is forgiven CANNOT depend on sales of specific securities or specific types of securities.</p>
</div>

#### 4. The Compliance Obligation

Reg BI requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce **written policies and
procedures** designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI.

Keep in mind the key distinction: these standards apply to broker-dealers.
<span class="key-term">Registered investment advisers</span> are already held to a
<span class="key-term">fiduciary standard</span> that requires them to always act in their
customers' best interest.

#### Form CRS (Customer Relationship Summary)

Broker-dealers and investment advisers must deliver a summary of their relationship with a customer
via <span class="key-term">Form CRS</span>, the Customer Relationship Summary.

**Form CRS must contain information about:**

- The relationship and services (broker-dealer or investment adviser)
- Fees and costs
- Conflicts of interest
- Standards of conduct
- Disciplinary history of the firm and its professionals
- How a customer can obtain additional information (e.g., via FINRA's BrokerCheck system)

**Delivery timing for broker-dealers -- Form CRS must be provided before or at the earliest of:**

- A recommendation of an account type
- A securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities
- Placing an order for a retail investor
- The opening of a brokerage account for a retail investor

**Additional Form CRS rules:**

- Must be filed with FINRA through the **FINRA Gateway**
- Changes to Form CRS must be sent to existing customers within **60 days**
- A current Form CRS must be provided to any customer **upon request** and **posted prominently** on
  the broker-dealer's website

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The disclosure obligation under Reg BI typically requires MORE information than what appears on Form CRS. Form CRS is a summary; the disclosure obligation is comprehensive. Don't confuse them on the exam.</p>
</div>

### Topic 3: Account Maintenance

#### Customer Order Verification

When taking an order, the firm must verify the customer's identity:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Order Verification Methods</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Order Method</th><th>Verification</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Telephone (known customer)</strong></td><td>Personal recognition by the representative</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Telephone (call center)</strong></td><td>Security questions ("What is your mother's maiden name?")</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Online</strong></td><td>Login with email and password verification</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Text message or email</strong></td><td>NOT accepted--no way to verify the sender</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

#### Trade Confirmations

Customers must be sent written confirmation of each transaction **at or before settlement**.

#### Errors in Confirmations

If a confirmation contains errors, the firm must send a corrected confirmation.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> If the price on a confirmation is wrong, the customer pays the actual execution price--not the price on the confirmation. If the confirmation says $20/share but the trade executed at $21, the customer owes $21. The confirmation doesn't change reality.</p>
</div>

#### Errors in Execution

If a trade was incorrectly executed:

- The original trade is canceled and rebilled at the correct amount
- The customer receives **two new confirmations**: one canceling the erroneous trade, one
  documenting the correction
- The customer pays the actual execution price
- All trade cancellations or adjustments must be **approved by a principal**

#### Errors in Client Instructions

If the client gave incorrect instructions, the client is obligated to accept the trade. For example,
if a customer wanted to buy 1,000 shares of ABA at market but told the firm to buy 1,000 shares of
AAB at market, the customer must pay for the AAB shares. You said it, you own it.

#### Delivery Instructions

Most securities today are issued in <span class="key-term">book-entry form</span>--an electronic
record on the books of the broker-dealer or issuer. But some physical certificates still exist. When
physical securities are involved, customers have four options for how to hold them:

**Transfer and Ship** -- Securities are delivered to the customer's address of record.

**Transfer and Hold** -- Securities are registered in the customer's name but held for safekeeping
by the brokerage firm. The firm may charge a fee for this service.

**Hold in Street Name** -- Securities are held in book-entry form and registered in the name of the
brokerage firm. The broker-dealer is the <span class="key-term">owner of record</span>; the investor
is the <span class="key-term">beneficial owner</span>, retaining all rights of ownership (dividends,
voting rights) without being listed directly on the issuer's books.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Securities are generally held in street name unless the investor specifically requests otherwise. And ALL securities in a margin account MUST be held in street name--no exceptions.</p>
</div>

**Direct Registration** -- Securities are registered in the purchaser's own name without a physical
certificate. The customer receives statements, dividends, annual reports, proxies, and other
mailings directly from the issuer, bypassing the broker entirely.

#### Cash and Mailing Instructions

Customers must instruct their broker-dealer on how to handle income and sales proceeds:

- Interest payments and dividends may be delivered in cash or reinvested
- Sale proceeds may be delivered directly to the customer, placed in a money market account, or
  credited to the investor's cash balance until reinvested

#### Quarterly Statements

- Customers must receive **quarterly statements** showing all positions at their current market
  value
- No statement is required for a quarter with no balance or securities
- If the customer owns <span class="key-term">penny stocks</span>, statements must be sent
  **monthly**
- Statements can be mailed or sent electronically at the customer's request
- Firms may charge for paper statements and confirmations, which is why many clients opt for
  electronic delivery
- A legend on account statements must direct customers to promptly report inaccuracies or
  discrepancies
- The phone number provided for reporting cannot be the representative's personal number

#### Holding Customer Mail

Customer mail must be sent to the address on the new account form or to a post office box designated
by the customer. It **cannot** be directed to the registered representative's office.

Customers may request in writing that mail be sent to an investment adviser or any individual with
power of attorney.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Mail Hold Rules</div>
  <p><strong>Up to 3 months within a 12-month period:</strong> Customer must request in writing.</p>
  <p><strong>Longer than 3 months:</strong> Written request must include an acceptable reason (e.g., safety or security concerns).</p>
  <p><strong>NOT an acceptable reason:</strong> Convenience. FINRA has explicitly stated that convenience does not justify holding mail beyond 3 months.</p>
</div>

#### Accounts Are the Property of the Firm

If a registered representative leaves a broker-dealer for any reason, all accounts are considered
the **property of the firm**. The broker-dealer will allocate the departing representative's
accounts among existing representatives.

If a representative inherits an account from a retiring or departing representative, the account
documents must be updated **before making any transactions** in the account.

#### Proxy Materials

When securities are held in <span class="key-term">street name</span>, the firm--not the
investor--is listed as the owner on the issuer's books. But the investor remains the
<span class="key-term">beneficial owner</span>, retaining all rights of ownership including
dividends and voting rights.

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>The term "street name" comes from Wall Street itself. Because so many broker-dealers were historically located on or near Wall Street, securities registered in the firm's name became known as being held "in the name of the street." The convention persists even though broker-dealers are now scattered across the country.</p>
</div>

A firm holding securities in street name must forward all issuer communications--annual reports,
proxy statements, and other materials--to the beneficial owner or their investment adviser.

The SEC requires companies to send a <span class="key-term">proxy statement</span> before every
stockholders' meeting. Whenever an issuer delivers proxy materials to a firm and promises to
reimburse out-of-pocket expenses, the member firm must promptly forward those materials to the
beneficial owner.

**Proxy statements provide information on upcoming votes, including:**

- Election of individuals to the board of directors
- Election or ratification of the company's accountant
- Authorization of new securities issues
- Modification or exchange of securities
- Any other submitted shareholder resolutions

### Topic 4: Senior Citizen Accounts

#### Senior Citizen Suitability

FINRA has stated that a customer's age and life stage are both important factors in determining
suitability. As investors age, their investment time horizons, goals, risk tolerance, and tax status
often change--and liquidity takes on added importance.

#### Typically Unsuitable Recommendations for Seniors

FINRA does not prohibit any particular recommendation to a senior citizen if it's genuinely
suitable. However, certain types of recommendations raise red flags:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Red Flags for Senior Accounts</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Purchase of variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities, or real estate limited partnerships</li>
    <li>Purchase of variable life settlements</li>
    <li>Purchase of complex structured products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)</li>
    <li>A recommendation to <strong>mortgage their residence</strong> to obtain investment funds</li>
    <li>A recommendation to use <strong>retirement savings</strong>, including early IRA withdrawals, to invest in high-risk investments</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Senior Certifications

FINRA is concerned about representatives using bogus certifications to appear more credible when
working with senior citizens.

**Prohibited designations** (these are not true professional designations):

- Certified Senior Adviser
- Certified Financial Gerontologist
- Senior Specialist
- Retirement Specialist

**Permitted designations** (independently conferred, requiring rigorous training):

- Certified Financial Planner (CFP)
- Certified Public Accountant (CPA)

#### Trusted Contact Person

FINRA requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name and contact information of a
<span class="key-term">trusted contact person</span> when opening an account. The member must
disclose in writing that the firm may contact the trusted contact person to:

- Disclose information about the client's account to address possible **financial exploitation**
- Confirm the specifics of the client's current **contact information or health status**
- Obtain the identity of any **legal guardian, executor, trustee, or holder of a power of attorney**

#### Diminished Mental Capacity

Firms must train employees to identify <span class="key-term">diminished mental capacity</span>.
FINRA requires an internal process that allows representatives to seek guidance from others on what
steps to take.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Steps when diminished capacity is suspected:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Document</strong> the suspected diminished capacity and escalate immediately to the designated individual at the firm</li>
    <li><strong>Suspend trading</strong> in the account until the concern is resolved</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate</strong> with the customer's designated emergency contact (next of kin) or the person with power of attorney</li>
    <li><strong>Maintain frequent contact</strong> with the investor and notify legal or compliance about these conversations</li>
    <li><strong>Consult state statutes</strong> to determine next steps, which may include alerting government protective services</li>
  </ol>
</div>

#### Financial Exploitation of Specified Adults

FINRA allows firms to place <span class="key-term">temporary holds on disbursements</span> from
client accounts when fraud is suspected. The investors FINRA considers particularly susceptible to
financial exploitation are:

- Individuals **aged 65 or older**
- Individuals **aged 18 or older** with a mental or physical impairment that makes them unable to
  protect their interests

FINRA refers to these individuals as <span class="key-term">specified adults</span>.

#### The Hold Timeline

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Temporary hold on suspicious disbursements:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial hold:</strong> 15 business days</li>
    <li><strong>Extension if exploitation is confirmed:</strong> Additional 10 business days</li>
    <li><strong>If state or federal investigation:</strong> Additional 30 days</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum total:</strong> 55 days (15 + 10 + 30)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The hold applies ONLY to suspicious disbursements, not to all account activity. Non-suspicious transactions can still proceed.</p>
</div>

If a hold is placed, the member must:

- **Document** the reason for the hold
- **Notify the trusted contact person**, UNLESS the trusted contact is suspected of being involved
  in the exploitation (in which case, do NOT notify them)

---

### Topic 5: Transferring and Closing Accounts

#### Internal Transfers

If a customer wants their account transferred to another broker at the **same firm**, the branch
manager must approve the transfer. No new account form is required.

#### External Account Transfers (ACATS)

When a customer wants to transfer to a **different firm**, the process begins with a
<span class="key-term">Transfer Initiation Form (TIF)</span>, provided by the firm that will receive
the assets--the <span class="key-term">receiving firm</span>.

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>ACATS Transfer Timeline:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Customer fills out TIF with the <strong>receiving firm</strong></li>
    <li>Receiving firm immediately sends a request-to-transfer to the <strong>carrying firm</strong> (also called the <strong>delivering firm</strong>)</li>
    <li>Carrying firm enters the request into the <strong>Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS)</strong>, operated by the NSCC</li>
    <li>Carrying firm has <strong>1 business day</strong> to validate or take exception to the transfer</li>
    <li>If validated, carrying firm sends a list of assets to the receiving firm via ACATS</li>
    <li>Carrying firm <strong>freezes the account</strong>, cancels all open orders (except options expiring within 7 days), and stops accepting new orders</li>
    <li>Receiving firm reviews the asset list and decides whether to accept</li>
    <li>If accepted, the delivering firm has <strong>3 additional business days</strong> to complete the transfer</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The transfer request must include the customer's name, Social Security number, and account number.</p>
</div>

#### Reasons a Carrying Firm May Reject a Transfer

The carrying firm isn't required to accept every transfer request. Common reasons for taking
exception include:

- The account contains no transferable assets
- Transfer instructions are incorrect
- The transfer would violate the firm's credit policy
- The receiving firm cannot identify the customer as the record owner of the assets
- The Social Security or tax ID number or account title doesn't match
- Authorization for the transfer is missing or incomplete
- The customer has already taken possession of the assets (or they're in transit)

However, FINRA prohibits broker-dealers from interfering with a customer's account transfer simply
because they don't want to lose the client.

#### Educational Brochure When Soliciting Account Transfers

<span class="key-term">FINRA Rule 2273</span> addresses situations where a representative moves to a
new firm and solicits former customers to follow them.

If such a solicitation is made, an **educational brochure** must be provided:

- With any **written solicitation**, or
- Within **3 business days** if the solicitation is oral

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Educational Brochure Contents</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The representative may receive <strong>incentives from the new firm</strong> that create a conflict of interest</li>
    <li>Some assets may <strong>not be transferable</strong>--they would need to be liquidated and the cash transferred, or if assets remain at the old firm, they may face higher maintenance fees</li>
    <li><strong>Fee structures</strong> can differ between firms; the new firm might charge more</li>
    <li><strong>Products and services</strong> available at each firm can differ</li>
  </ul>
</div>

The brochure must be delivered within a **3-month window** following the representative's
association with the new firm. The rule also applies if a former customer seeks to transfer assets
without being individually contacted--in that case, the customer must receive the brochure with the
approved account transfer documentation.

#### Death of a Customer

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Three immediate steps when a customer dies:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cancel all open orders</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Mark the account "deceased"</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Freeze the account</strong> (pending instructions from the executor)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>All powers of attorney and third-party authorizations, including discretionary authority, are <strong>immediately terminated</strong> upon the customer's death.</p>
</div>

The executor of the customer's estate will typically transfer assets to an estate account. No
changes can be made until proper legal documents are provided:

- **Letters testamentary** (court-issued documents verifying the executor's identity)
- **Inheritance tax waivers** (required in some states)
- A **certified copy of the death certificate**
- An **affidavit of domicile**

#### Estate Accounts

<span class="key-term">Estate accounts</span> are a type of trust whose purpose is to safeguard a
deceased person's assets pending probate. A designated executor creates this temporary account to
hold assets while settling the estate.

To open an estate account, the executor needs:

- A **taxpayer ID number** in the estate's name (obtained from the IRS)
- A copy of the deceased's **death certificate**
- A list of **bank accounts** held by the deceased
- Proof of the executor's **legal status**

The firm may also be asked to value the securities in the account--the market value of all
securities should be determined as of the **date of death**.

**How different account types handle death:**

- In a <span class="key-term">joint tenants in common (JTIC or TIC)</span> account, the executor
  legally transfers the deceased's proportional share of assets into the estate account
- In a <span class="key-term">joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS)</span> account, the
  assets transfer to the surviving owner(s) **without going through probate**
- Upon the death of a child, assets in a <span class="key-term">Uniform Gifts to Minors Act
  (UGMA)</span> account are NOT transferred to the parents--they become part of the child's estate

#### Transfer on Death (TOD) Accounts

Most states allow account holders to name a beneficiary to inherit securities without going through
probate court. Customers register the securities with the broker using a
<span class="key-term">transfer on death (TOD)</span> designation form, naming one or more
individuals to receive the securities upon their death.

TOD beneficiaries typically need only:

- A **certified copy of the death certificate**
- **Proof of identity**

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Although TOD accounts avoid probate, the assets are still subject to estate taxes. "Avoiding probate" and "avoiding taxes" are two very different things--the exam will test whether you know the difference.</p>
</div>
