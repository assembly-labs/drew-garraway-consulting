## Section 1: Customer Accounts for Individuals

### Introduction
- Before opening a new account, a registered representative (RR) is required to gather and record a great deal of information
- This information relates to establishing customer identity and suitability, and fulfilling anti-money laundering requirements

### Topic 1: New Account Form

#### Required Information on New Account Form
- FINRA requires the new account information for each customer:
  - Customer name and address
  - Whether the customer is of legal age (date of birth is not initially required to open an account)
  - Name of registered representatives who will handle the account (not a requirement for institutional accounts)
  - Principal's signature (but customer's signature is not required)
  - Representative's signature if the representative completed the suitability determination (not required if client submitted online)
  - If the customer is a corporation, the name of the person who will transact business in the account

#### Reasonable Efforts for Non-Mutual Fund Accounts
- If the account is for an individual (who is not simply purchasing unsolicited mutual funds), the broker should make **reasonable efforts** to obtain the following information before the settlement of the first transaction:
  - Social Security number or tax identification (ID) number (note: this information must be provided to verify the person's identity)
  - Occupation of customer and address of employer
  - Whether the customer is employed by a bank or broker-dealer
  - Whether the customer is an officer or director at a publicly held company
  - Citizenship
  - Whether it's a cash or margin account
  - Third-party authorization (if any)

#### Suitability Information
- For suitability purposes, a reasonable effort must be made to obtain:
  - Customer's age (date of birth will be required to verify the person's identity)
  - Investment experience
  - Investment time horizon and liquidity needs
  - Risk tolerance
  - Financial situation and needs
  - Investment objectives and other holdings
  - Estimated annual income
  - Tax status

#### Test-Taking Tip
- Neither the customer's signature nor educational background need to be on the new account form

#### Copy of New Account Form
- A copy of the new account form must be sent to the customer:
  - Within 30 days of opening the account
  - At least every 3 years thereafter to verify and update the customer's information
  - Within 30 days of any updates
- Customer records must be maintained for at least 6 years after the information was last updated and for at least 6 years after the account is closed

#### Predispute Arbitration Agreement
- It is **not mandatory** that a customer sign an arbitration agreement
- Most new account forms contain a **predispute arbitration agreement**, in which the customer agrees to arbitration if a dispute arises with the firm or its associated persons, rather than suing them in a court of law
- No FINRA or SEC rule requires that customers sign an arbitration agreement as part of account opening
- However, virtually every firm requires customers to sign such an agreement before opening an account
- This is because mandatory arbitration is a more cost-effective and expedited way of resolving disputes

#### Predispute Arbitration Agreement Disclosures
- FINRA requires that, if a member firm includes a predispute arbitration agreement, it must be highlighted and include language to explain that:
  - The customer is giving up their right to sue
  - Arbitration is final and binding
  - Arbitrators do not have to explain the reasons for their award
  - Arbitration panels include a minority of individuals who were, or are, affiliated with the securities industry

### Topic 2: Customer Identification and Verification

#### USA PATRIOT Act
- The USA PATRIOT Act requires member firms to use a customer's name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number or tax ID number to independently verify their identity
- Verification can be done with a government-issued photo ID, such as:
  - A current driver's license
  - A passport
  - An alien registration card
  - A green card
- Another government-issued identification (a Social Security card is not acceptable)
- The verification must be completed within a reasonable amount of time after the account is opened

#### Customer Identification Program (CIP)
- Firms are also required to check if the person is on a known or suspected terrorist list provided by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)
- This list is called the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list
- These rules are included to detect and deter money laundering and the funding of terrorist organizations
- Records relating to identification verification must be kept for at least 5 years

#### Know Your Customer (KYC)
- The Know Your Customer (KYC) rule requires broker-dealers to use "reasonable diligence" in collecting and maintaining essential information on their customers
- The rule requires firms to check:
  - Customers' identities
  - Investment histories
  - Investment objectives
  - Sources of funds
- This information is used to ensure that customers are not engaging in money laundering; it is also used in making suitable recommendations for the customers' accounts
- If the customer does not provide all the required information on a new account form, the account may still be opened if the firm collects certain essential facts. These include facts necessary to:
  - Effectively service a customer's account
  - Carry out special handling instructions for the account
  - Understand who has trading authority on the account
  - Comply with securities laws, regulations, and rules
- When information on the new account form is missing, a supervisor must be informed, and inquiries should be made and documented as to why the missing information was not provided
- The supervisor should make sure that any missing information is not an essential fact

#### Know Your Customer Rule — Updates
- The Know Your Customer rule also requires that the firm make regular contact with customers to check if investment objectives or essential facts have changed
- While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires broker-dealers to update suitability information at least every 3 years, the Know Your Customer obligation may require broker-dealers to update their customers' information more often

#### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Requirements
- In an effort to combat terrorism and other illicit activities, the government instituted anti-money laundering (AML) requirements
- First codified under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and later adopted by brokerage firms and other types of financial institutions

#### Money Laundering Phases
- Money laundering has 3 phases:
  1. **Placement**: The initial entry of illicit cash into the financial system. This is often done by making cash deposits in a financial institution below reporting thresholds, purchasing gambling chips, or mixing it with legitimate business cash
  2. **Layering**: Once cash has been deposited, the funds are often wired to a series of other financial institutions making it difficult to trace the funds back to their source
  3. **Integration**: The final stage of money laundering, where the funds are returned to the criminal from what appear to be legitimate sources

#### Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)
- The BSA also requires financial institutions to report currency transactions (deposits or withdrawals of cash) in amounts that exceed $10,000
- If a financial institution receives a cash deposit or withdrawal of more than $10,000, it must report this to FinCEN on a Currency Transaction Report (CTR)
- CTR reports must be filed with FinCEN within 15 days of crossing the $10,000 threshold

#### Structuring
- Making a series of smaller deposits or withdrawals to avoid the $10,000 limit is known as **structuring**
- For example, if an individual deposits $4,000 in cash at 8:00 a.m., deposits another $4,000 at 1:00 p.m., and another $4,000 at 3:00 p.m., this would trigger a CTR filing because it is a cash deposit of over $10,000 in one day
- If an individual is making repeated deposits under the $10,000 limit over several days, or even weeks or months, and the representative believes that this is being done intentionally, this would still be referred to as structuring
- Note: A firm must file both an SAR and CTR if the $10,000 limit is exceeded and the firm suspects the customer may be involved in illegal activity

#### Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)
- The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires broker-dealers to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) — part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury — which acts as the central collection point for these reports
- If potential money laundering or violations of the BSA are detected or suspected, for any dollar amount, a report is required to be filed within 30 days
- Beginning 1/1/2026, firms must notify FinCEN regarding the Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) of each account held by the firm in street name
- **Test-Taking Tip**: The Bank Secrecy Act forbids anyone who files a Suspicious Activity Report from notifying any person involved in the suspected activity that an SAR has been filed

#### Monetary Instrument Log (MIL)
- Broker-dealers must make a record of cash purchases of negotiable instruments (personal checks, money orders, travelers' checks) between $3,000 and $10,000 in an internal log called a monetary instrument log (MIL)
- **Test-Taking Tip**: MIL documents must be kept for 5 years

#### Firm AML Program
- Each firm must establish an anti-money laundering (AML) program
- The firm must appoint a designated AML compliance officer responsible for creating written supervisory procedures
- The program must:
  - Include procedures reasonably designed to detect and report suspicious activity
  - Have a risk-based customer identification program (CIP)
  - Independently test the program at least annually
  - Provide ongoing training to appropriate personnel

#### Numbered Accounts
- Customers are allowed to open a numbered account
- By using a number or a symbol instead of a name, the customer can remain anonymous when placing trades
- The firm is still required to include the customer's identity on the new account form, and the owner must sign the form
- This document must be kept on file at the broker-dealer
- Customers may also open multiple individual accounts at a single broker-dealer, but the customer must sign a statement that the accounts are not for any other individual

---

### Topic 3: Regulation S-P

#### Privacy of Customer Information
- Regulation S-P (Reg S-P) limits the ability of broker-dealers, investment companies, and investment advisers to disclose personally identifiable information (PII) about their customers to nonaffiliated third parties
- **Test-Taking Tip**: The exam may refer to personally identifiable information as PII, so be sure to know this acronym

#### Privacy Notice Requirements
- Firms must provide customers with a notice describing their privacy policies and procedures when an account is opened and annually thereafter
- The privacy notice must describe the type of information that will be collected, how it will be used, and the categories of entities with whom the information will be shared
- The regulation covers both **consumers** and **customers**
  - Consumers are individuals who provide information to a firm but do not have an ongoing relationship
  - Customers have an ongoing relationship
  - An individual who completes an application but then decides to withdraw that application would be considered a consumer
- A firm is only required to provide an initial privacy notice to consumers if it wishes to disclose any of their information
- Both customers and consumers must also be given adequate notice to opt out of sharing personal information with third parties

#### Written Plan for Safeguarding
- Reg S-P also requires firms to have a written plan that covers the safeguarding of customer information
- The plan must be designed to:
  - Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information
  - Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to customer records and information
  - Protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information
- Personal information must be properly disposed of, and firms must protect against unauthorized access to disposed information
- Firms must also conduct periodic reviews to detect potential problems in their databases

#### Privacy Policies Table

| | Consumer | Customer |
|---|---|---|
| Notice | Initial notice required if firm wants to disclose information | Initial and annual notice required |
| Opt out provision | Required if firm wants to disclose information | Required |

### Topic 4: Trading Authorizations and Discretionary Accounts

#### Account Ownership
- An individual account has only one owner
- A representative may not give account information to anyone else, including the account owner's spouse
- The owner is the only person who can trade in the account unless trading authorization has been granted

#### Three Types of Trading Authorization
1. **Limited trading authority** — allows a third party to trade in the account, but not to make withdrawals
2. **Full trading authority** — allows a third party to trade and to make withdrawals
3. **Discretionary authority** — gives a representative authority to trade in the account

#### Without Discretionary Authority (AAA Rule)
- Without discretionary authority, a representative needs 3 pieces of information from the customer to make a transaction (remember: **AAA**):
  - **A**sset — the name of the security
  - **A**ction — whether to buy or sell
  - **A**mount — the amount of the security to be traded
- In most cases, discretionary authority is not required to exercise **discretion over time and price**
- This means the broker-dealer may wait for the best time or price at which to execute a customer order, as long as it is executed the day the customer places it

#### Discretionary Accounts
- Discretionary authority must be given in writing before the account can be opened
- A discretionary account typically requires the customer to grant their representative a **power of attorney (POA)**
- In most cases, the POA grants limited trading authorization (to trade the account), not full authorization (to make withdrawals)
- **Test-Taking Tip**: Even with a POA, a registered representative cannot sign documents for a customer

#### Churning in Discretionary Accounts
- Churning is a major concern with discretionary accounts
- Churning is the entering of excessive, often unsuitable transactions to generate commissions for the representative
- To ensure compliance and detect any violations, a principal of the firm must approve all discretionary accounts before they are opened
- A principal must also promptly approve all discretionary orders in writing and review all discretionary accounts at frequent intervals

### Topic 5: Accounts for Employees of Other Firms and FINRA Employees

#### Account for Employee of Another Member
- FINRA and the MSRB have similar rules for opening an account for an associated person of another member firm
- The following procedures must be followed:
  - **Written notice to executing member**: The associated person must notify the "executing" firm (the firm where the account will be opened) in writing that they are an associated person of another firm
  - **Written consent of employer member**: The associated person must have written consent from their employer
  - **Duplicate confirmations and statements sent on request**: The executing firm must send duplicate trade confirmations and statements to the employer upon written request
- Note: The MSRB requires firms to send duplicate confirmations and statements without a written request
- The rule applies to all employees of broker-dealers who attempt to open accounts at other member firms
- The rule also applies to accounts opened by broker-dealer employees at non-member financial institutions such as banks, trust companies, and investment advisers

#### Related and Other Persons
- The rule also applies to any account that is held by:
  - The spouse of the associated person
  - A child who lives in the same household or is financially dependent upon the associated person
  - Any other related individual over whose account the associated person has control
  - Any other individual the associated person has control over and provides financial support
- All such accounts must be disclosed to the representative's employing broker-dealer
- The rule does not apply to accounts limited to investment company securities or municipal fund securities (such as 529 plans)

#### Restrictions on Accounts of FINRA Employees
- FINRA also has specific rules for employees of FINRA itself who wish to open accounts at member firms
- FINRA employees, either directly or through accounts that they control, cannot have a debt or equity interest in broker-dealers or companies with broker-dealer subsidiaries that contribute 10% or more of the parent's revenue
- FINRA employees cannot take options positions on these firms and cannot purchase stock in an IPO
- FINRA employees must disclose to FINRA all brokerage accounts that they own or control, and they must authorize the broker-dealer to send duplicate statements to FINRA

## Section 2: Suitability and Account Maintenance

### Introduction
- One reason for collecting new account information is to ensure that future recommendations will be suitable for a particular customer
- All regulators, including FINRA, the MSRB, and the SEC have established suitability standards
- As with all regulations, the SEC has the final say
- And **Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)** is the ultimate standard for client suitability

### Topic 1: FINRA and MSRB Suitability Requirements

#### Suitability Information Collection
- FINRA requires firms to evaluate whether each recommendation is suitable for the customer
- This involves collecting information on:
  - A customer's age
  - Time horizon (length of investment time)
  - Liquidity needs
  - Risk tolerance
  - Tax status
  - Current and future financial needs
  - Investment experience
- A suitability questionnaire should be provided at account opening and kept in the customer's file
- Firms must make reasonable efforts to collect and maintain this information
- The customer's questionnaire should be revisited and updated frequently, at least every 36 months

#### Three Components of Suitability (Repeated from Ch 19)
- **Reasonable-basis obligation** — the firm and rep must understand the complexity and risks of a security or investment strategy, and determine whether it is suitable for at least some investors
- **Customer-specific obligation** — a broker-dealer must believe that a recommendation is suitable for each customer based on their personal and investment profile
- **Quantitative suitability obligation** — a broker-dealer must believe that a series of recommended securities transactions is not excessive
- A suitability analysis must be conducted before a representative can make any recommendations
- However, a representative may accept unsolicited orders from a customer who has not provided suitability information

#### Institutional Customers Exception
- Broker-dealers are not subject to the same strict suitability rules for institutional customers
- An institutional customer is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company, registered investment company, registered investment adviser, or individual with total assets of at least $50 million
- If the firm believes an institutional customer can evaluate risk, and the customer has stated that it is acting independently, the broker-dealer has met its suitability requirements

#### Municipal Securities Suitability
- The MSRB suitability rule is similar to those of FINRA and the SEC
- A few additions:
  - Firms must determine tax status by asking the customer for their tax bracket and state of residence
  - If a customer refuses to disclose their financial status, no recommendations can be made (unsolicited trades can still be accepted from this customer)
  - If the representative feels an unsolicited trade is unsuitable, the customer must be informed. If the customer insists, the unsolicited order can then be entered
- **Test-Taking Tip**: Although not expressly prohibited, municipal securities are generally not suitable investments for tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs

#### Suitability by Type of Investor

| Type of Investor | Suitable Investments |
|---|---|
| **Older investors** (at the time of investing) | U.S. Treasuries, Treasury bond funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highly rated corporate bond funds and ETFs, high-paying "blue-chip" dividend stocks, dividend funds and ETFs, bank certificates of deposit (CDs), immediate annuities |
| **Investors in a high-income tax bracket** | Municipal securities, investments where income is deferred (private placements, limited partnerships, DPPs), tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, 529 accounts) |
| **Long-term investors** | Equities, equity index mutual funds and equity index ETFs, balanced funds, real estate, annuities, tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, 529 accounts), REITs, buy-and-hold strategies |

### Topic 2: Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)

#### Overview
- The SEC's Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) provides a set of standards that exceed accounts' suitability requirements
- Reg BI requires broker-dealers and their associated persons to act in their **retail customers' best interest**
- This means the firm cannot place its own financial interests ahead of its customers'
- Firms must also identify, eliminate, or disclose and mitigate any conflicts of interest between the firm and its retail customers

#### Retail Customer Definition
- A customer is considered a retail customer for purposes of Reg BI if all the following statements are true:
  - The customer is a natural person (not a corporation) or a natural person's legal representative (such as a trustee or executor)
  - The customer receives a recommendation from a broker-dealer about any securities or any strategy involving securities
  - The customer uses the recommendation primarily for their personal investing (or that of their family or household)
- Note: Accredited investors, who are required to meet specific net worth requirements, are not excluded from being considered retail customers
- Likewise, Reg BI applies to recommendations about private placements, over-the-counter (OTC) trades, and any other securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities

#### Recommendations Under Reg BI
- Reg BI applies to recommendations made across accounts, including margin, retirement, and education savings accounts
- Recommendations about the kind of account to open are also covered (for example, recommendations to open a traditional IRA versus a Roth IRA)
- Recommendations about rollovers or transfers from one account to another are also covered
- Simply discussing investment options is not considered a recommendation, nor is providing general information (such as annual contribution limits for retirement accounts)
- However, statements involving a **call to action** are generally considered recommendations
- **Test-Taking Tip**: Customers cannot waive Reg BI's protections under any circumstances

#### Four Obligations of Reg BI
1. **The disclosure obligation**
2. **The care obligation**
3. **The conflict-of-interest obligation**
4. **The compliance obligation**

#### The Disclosure Obligation
- Requires that, before or at the time of making a recommendation, firms provide in writing full and fair disclosure of the following material facts:
  - That the firm is acting in a broker-dealer capacity
  - Material fees and costs
  - Type and scope of services provided
  - Any material limitations on the securities or investment strategies
  - All material facts relating to conflicts of interest associated with a recommendation (e.g., conflicts associated with proprietary products, payments from third parties, or compensation arrangements)

#### The Care Obligation
- The SEC defines 3 components of the care obligation; these components resemble the three components of suitable recommendations in FINRA's rules:
  - **Reasonable-basis**: A broker-dealer must understand the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with a recommendation
  - **Customer-specific suitability obligation**: A broker-dealer must consider the potential risks, rewards, and costs associated with a customer's investment profile. Recommendations must be in the customer's best interest and can't place the broker-dealer's best interest ahead of a customer's. Reasonable alternatives should be considered when making a recommendation
  - **Quantitative suitability obligation**: A broker-dealer cannot recommend a series of transactions that are excessive. Even if each transaction is in the customer's best interest individually, the transactions may not be when looked at in combination (for example, a representative may not recommend multiple transactions to earn higher fees)

#### The Conflict-of-Interest Obligation
- Broker-dealers must establish, maintain, and enforce procedures to address conflicts of interest
- Specifically, a broker-dealer must:
  - Identify and mitigate conflicts that might create an incentive for a broker-dealer to put its interests ahead of the customer's
  - Identify and disclose material limitations on offerings (e.g., only offering proprietary funds) and prevent the limitations from putting the firm's interests ahead of a customer's
  - Identify and eliminate sales contests, sales quotas, bonuses, and noncash compensation that are based on the sales of specific securities (e.g., a sales contest for mutual funds sponsored by a particular company). However, general categories of securities are exempt from this rule (e.g., a contest for overall sales of all mutual funds would be acceptable)
- Note: Some hiring bonuses take the form of forgivable loans that must be repaid if a new hire fails to meet certain performance goals. Whether such a loan is forgiven cannot depend on sales of specific securities or specific types of securities

#### The Compliance Obligation
- Reg BI requires broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with Reg BI
- Keep in mind that these standards apply to broker-dealers. **Registered investment advisers** are already held to a **fiduciary standard** that requires them to always act in their customers' best interest

#### Form CRS
- Broker-dealers and investment advisers are required to deliver a summary of their relationship with a customer
- The summary is provided in **Form CRS**, the Customer Relationship Summary
- New customers should receive a copy of Form CRS at the beginning of the relationship
- Form CRS must contain information about:
  - The relationship and services (broker-dealer or investment adviser)
  - Fees and costs
  - Conflicts of interest
  - Standards of conduct
  - Disciplinary history of the firm and its professionals
  - How a customer can obtain additional information on the firm (e.g., FINRA's BrokerCheck system)
- Broker-dealers must deliver Form CRS to each retail investor before or at the earliest of:
  - A recommendation of an account type
  - A securities transaction or an investment strategy involving securities
  - Placing an order for a retail investor
  - The opening of a brokerage account for a retail investor
- Broker-dealers are required to file Form CRS with FINRA through the FINRA Gateway
- Any changes to Form CRS must be sent to existing customers within 60 days
- A current Form CRS must be provided to any customer upon request and posted prominently on the broker-dealer's website
- Note: The disclosure obligation under Reg BI typically requires more information than is provided on Form CRS

---

### Topic 3: Account Maintenance

#### Customer Order Verification
- When taking an order from a customer, the firm must be able to verify the customer's identity in the following ways:
  - For orders placed over the telephone, if the representative knows the customer personally, it is considered verification
  - If the order is placed by telephone to a call center, then the customer will be asked to answer security questions ("What is your mother's maiden name?") to verify identity
  - If the order is placed online, it can only be accepted after the customer logs into their account (which is password-protected), where the email and password can be verified
  - Orders placed by other means, such as text messages or emails, cannot be accepted because there is no way to verify who is placing them

#### Confirmations Sent Day After Trade Date
- Customers must be sent written confirmation of each transaction at or before settlement

#### Error in Confirmation
- If a confirmation contains any errors, the firm must send a corrected confirmation to the customer
- **Test-Taking Tip**: If the price is incorrectly reported, the customer must pay the actual price at which the trade was executed (e.g., if confirmation states $20/share but actual price was $21, customer pays $21)

#### Error in Execution
- If a trade was incorrectly executed, the original trade will be canceled and rebilled in the correct amount
- The customer will receive two new confirmations — one canceling the erroneous trade and the other documenting the correction
- The customer must pay the actual price at which the trade was executed
- All trade cancellations or adjustments must be approved by a principal

#### Error in Client Instructions
- If a client incorrectly gave the trade instructions, the client is obligated to accept the trade (e.g., customer wanted to buy 1,000 shares of ABA @ market but told the firm to buy 1,000 shares of AAB @ market, they are required to pay for the shares)

#### Delivery Instructions
- Most securities are issued in book-entry form as an electronic record on the books of the broker-dealer or issuer
- Some physical certificates continue to circulate
- If physical securities are involved, the purchaser can choose how to hold these securities:

##### Transfer and Ship
- Securities are delivered to the customer's address of record

##### Transfer and Hold
- Securities will be registered in the customer's name but held for safekeeping by the brokerage firm. The broker-dealer may charge a fee for providing this service

##### Hold in Street Name
- Securities are held in book-entry form and are registered in the name of the brokerage firm
- The broker-dealer is the official owner of the securities and is known as the **owner of record**
- The investor is the **beneficial owner**, meaning that they have the benefits of ownership but are not listed directly on the issuer's books
- Securities are generally held this way unless the investor specifically requests otherwise
- All securities in a margin account must be held in street name

##### Direct Registration
- Securities are registered in the purchaser's own name without a physical certificate
- Customers receive periodic account statements, dividends, annual reports, proxies, and other mailings directly from the issuer without the mediation of a broker

#### Cash and Mailing Instructions
- Customers must also instruct their broker-dealer on how to handle income and sales proceeds
- Interest payments and dividends may be delivered to the customer in cash or reinvested
- Proceeds from the sale of securities may be delivered directly to the customer, placed in a money market account, or credited to the investor's cash balance until they are reinvested

#### Quarterly Statements
- Customers must receive quarterly statements showing all positions in the account at their current market value
- A statement does not need to be sent for a quarter during which there was no balance or securities in the account
- If the customer owns penny stocks, statements must be sent monthly
- Statements must be mailed to the customer, or, alternatively, if the customer requests, the statements can be sent electronically to an email address provided by the customer
- Firms are permitted to charge for paper statements and confirmations, so many clients opt for electronic delivery
- A legend must be placed on account statements, and the customer must promptly report any inaccuracies or discrepancies to the firm
- The phone number given cannot be that of the representative

#### Firms Cannot Generally Hold Customer Mail
- Customer mail must be sent to the address on the new account form or to a post office box designated by the customer
- Customer mail cannot be directed to the registered representative's office
- Customers may request that their mail be sent instead to an investment adviser or any individual with power of attorney, provided they submit the request in writing
- If the customer requests it in writing, a customer's mail can be held for up to 3 months within a 12-month period
- If the customer wishes the mail to be held longer, their written instruction must include an acceptable reason (e.g., safety or security concerns)
- Note that FINRA states that convenience is not an acceptable reason for holding mail for longer than 3 months

#### Accounts Are the Property of the Broker-Dealer
- If a registered representative leaves a broker-dealer for any reason, all accounts are considered the property of the firm
- The broker-dealer will allocate the departing representative's accounts among the existing representatives at that firm
- If a registered representative inherits an account (e.g., from a retiring registered representative or one that has left the firm), the account documents must be updated before making any transactions in the account

#### Proxy Materials
- To facilitate trading, the ownership of a security is usually registered in the name of the broker-dealer
- The purchaser of the security remains the beneficial owner of the security, meaning they retain all the rights of ownership, including dividends and voting rights
- This type of registration is called holding the securities in **street name** as many broker-dealers were located on Wall Street
- A firm that holds securities in street name is required to forward all information it receives from the issuer (such as annual reports) to the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner's investment adviser
- The SEC requires companies to send shareholders a proxy statement before every stockholders' meeting
- Whenever an issuer delivers proxy materials to a firm and promises to reimburse the firm for any out-of-pocket expenses, the member firm must promptly send those materials to the beneficial owner
- A proxy statement provides information relevant to upcoming votes, such as:
  - The election of individuals to the board of directors
  - The election or ratification of the company's accountant
  - Authorization of new securities issues
  - The modification or exchange of securities
  - Any other submitted shareholder resolutions

---

### Topic 4: Senior Citizen Accounts

#### Senior Citizen Suitability
- FINRA has stated that a customer's age and life stage are both important factors when determining suitability
- It states that as investors age, their investment time horizons, goals, risk tolerance, and tax status often change, and that liquidity takes on added importance

#### Typically Unsuitable Recommendations for Seniors
- FINRA does not prohibit any particular recommendation to a senior citizen if it is suitable; however, certain types of recommendations are red flags:
  - Purchase of variable annuities, equity-indexed annuities, and real estate limited partnerships
  - Purchase of variable life settlements
  - Purchase of complex structured products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
  - A recommendation to mortgage their residence to obtain funds for investment purposes
  - A recommendation to use retirement savings, including early withdrawals from IRAs, to invest in high-risk investments

#### Senior Certifications
- FINRA is concerned about registered representatives using bogus certifications when making presentations to senior citizens
- Claiming to be a Certified Senior Adviser, a Certified Financial Gerontologist, a Senior Specialist, or a Retirement Specialist is prohibited since these are not true professional designations
- If a representative holds an independently conferred designation that requires rigorous training, such as a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or Certified Public Accountant (CPA), these designations can be used

#### Trusted Contact Person
- FINRA requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name and contact information of a **trusted contact person** when opening an account for a client
- The member must disclose in writing to the client that the firm or associated person will be authorized to contact the trusted contact person to:
  - Disclose information about the client's account to address possible financial exploitation
  - Confirm the specifics of the client's current contact information or health status
  - Obtain the identity of any legal guardian, executor, trustee, or holder of a power of attorney

#### Senior Citizen Suspected of Diminished Mental Capacity
- Firms must train their employees to identify diminished mental capacity
- FINRA requires that firms have an internal process to permit representatives to seek advice from others on what steps to take
- The representative should document the suspected diminished capacity and escalate immediately
- The firm should have a designated individual to whom the matter is directed
- Once the problem is identified and escalated, the next step for the firm is to suspend trading in the account until the concern is resolved
- Then, the firm should:
  - Communicate with the customer's designated emergency contact person (next of kin) or a person given power of attorney over the account to discuss the situation
  - Maintain frequent contact with the investor to assess the situation and notify legal or compliance about these conversations
  - Consult appropriate state statutes to determine the next steps, which may include alerting appropriate authorities, such as government protective services

#### Financial Exploitation of Senior Citizens and Disabled Adults
- FINRA allows firms to place temporary holds on disbursements from client accounts when fraud is suspected
- The investors who FINRA believes are particularly susceptible to financial exploitation are:
  - Individuals aged 65 or older
  - Individuals aged 18 or older, where the member believes that the individual has a mental or physical impairment, making the individual unable to protect their interests
- FINRA refers to these vulnerable individuals as **specified adults**

#### 15-Business Day Hold
- If the member or associated person suspects financial exploitation, it may place a **15-business day hold** on the disbursement of funds from the client's account
- Note that this hold only applies to suspicious disbursements, not to ones that are not suspicious
- If the member's review supports the belief that the client is being financially exploited, the member can extend the temporary hold for another 10 business days
- Additionally, if the activity becomes part of a state or federal investigation, an additional hold of 30 days can be added for a total of 55 days
- If a hold is put on the account, the member must document why it has been done
- The member must notify the trusted contact person, unless the trusted contact person is suspected of being involved in the exploitation, in which case the member must not notify them

### Topic 5: Transferring and Closing Accounts

#### Transfer of Account Within the Firm
- If a customer wishes to have their account transferred to another broker at the same firm, the branch manager must approve the transfer
- There is no requirement to complete another new account form

#### External Account Transfers
- When a customer wishes to transfer an account to another firm, they will begin the process by filling out a **Transfer Initiation Form (TIF)**
- This form is provided by the firm that will be receiving the account's assets — the **receiving firm**
- The receiving firm must immediately send a request-to-transfer to the customer's current broker dealer. This firm is referred to as the **carrying firm** or the **delivering firm**
- The carrying firm will then enter the request into an automated account transfer system operated by the NSCC, called the **Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS)**
- The information in the request must include the customer's name, Social Security number, and account number

#### ACATS Transfer Timeline
- The ACATS system will then transfer the transfer to the carrying firm
- The carrying firm has one business day to either validate or take exception to the transfer
- If the transfer request is validated, the carrying firm will send a list of the assets in the account to the receiving firm via ACATS
- The carrying firm will also freeze the customer's account, canceling all open orders (except options that will expire within 7 days), and will no longer accept any new orders
- If the customer wants to submit any new orders, they will need to be given to the receiving firm
- The receiving firm will review the list of assets to decide whether it wishes to accept the transfer
- If it accepts the transfer, the delivering firm has **3 additional business days** to complete the transfer of assets

#### Reasons Carrying Firm May Reject Transfer
- The carrying firm is not required to accept the transfer of an account. Some of the more common reasons to take exception are:
  - The account contains no transferrable assets
  - The transfer instructions are incorrect
  - The transfer would violate the firm's credit policy
  - The receiving firm cannot identify the customer as the record owner of one or more of the assets
  - The Social Security or tax identification number or the account's title does not match
  - The authorization for the transfer is missing or incomplete
  - The customer has already taken possession of the assets (or they are already in transit)
- However, FINRA prohibits broker-dealers from interfering with a customer's account transfer simply because they do not want to lose the client

#### Customers Solicited to Move Accounts Must Receive an Educational Brochure
- FINRA Rule 2273 covers the situation where a representative transfers from one broker-dealer to another and solicits former customers to move their accounts to the new firm
- FINRA requires that, if such a solicitation is made, an educational brochure must be provided to the former customers with any written solicitation, or, if the solicitation is oral, the written brochure must be sent within 3 business days
- The educational brochure details that:
  - The representative may receive incentives from the new firm that create a conflict of interest
  - Some assets may not be transferable — they would have to be liquidated and the cash transferred, or, if assets remain at the old firm, they may be subject to higher account maintenance fees
  - Fee structures can be different at the two firms, so that the new firm might have higher fees
  - Products and services available at each firm can be different
- The educational brochure must be delivered within the 3-month window following the representative's association with the new firm
- The rule also applies if the former customer seeks to transfer assets to another firm without being individually contacted. In that case, the customer must receive the brochure with the approved account transfer documentation

#### Death of a Customer
- If a customer dies, the representative must do 3 things:
  1. Cancel all open orders
  2. Mark the account "deceased"
  3. Freeze the account (pending further instructions from the executor)
- All powers of attorney or third-party authorization, such as discretionary authority, are immediately terminated upon the death of a customer
- The executor of the customer's estate will typically transfer the assets in the account to an estate account; however, no changes can be made until the proper legal documents are provided. These documents may include:
  - Letters testamentary (issued by a court to verify the identity of the executor)
  - Inheritance tax waivers (required in some states)
  - A certified copy of the death certificate
  - An affidavit of domicile

#### Estate Accounts
- Estate accounts are a type of trust whose purpose is to safeguard a deceased person's assets pending probate
- A designated executor will create this temporary account to hold the assets while settling the estate
- To open an estate account, the executor must acquire a taxpayer ID number in the estate's name from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
- Along with the ID number, the executor will need a copy of the deceased's death certificate, a list of bank accounts held by the deceased, and proof of the executor's legal status
- The firm may also be asked to value the securities in the account (as the market value of all securities should be determined as of the date of death)
- In a joint tenants in common (JTIC, or sometimes just TIC) account, the executor of the estate legally transfers the proportion of assets owned by the deceased into the estate account
- In a **joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS)** account, the assets will be transferred to the other owners of the account without going through probate
- Upon the death of a child, the assets in a Uniform Gifts to Minors account are not transferred to the child's parents but become part of the child's estate

#### Transfer on Death (TOD) Accounts
- Most states allow account holders to name a beneficiary to inherit the securities in their account without having to go through probate court
- Customers register the securities with the broker using a **transfer on death (TOD)** designation form, and name one or more individuals to receive the securities upon their death
- The TOD beneficiaries typically only need a certified copy of the death certificate and proof of identity to receive the securities
- Although they avoid probate, assets in a TOD account are still subject to estate taxes
