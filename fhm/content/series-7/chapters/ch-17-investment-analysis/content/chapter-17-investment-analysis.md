# Chapter 17: Investment Analysis

_Series 7 Exam Weight: ~3-5% of exam_

---

In 1934, a pair of Columbia Business School professors published a 725-page book called _Security
Analysis_. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd argued that stocks had an intrinsic value that could be
calculated by examining a company's financial statements—and that the market's mood swings created
opportunities for disciplined investors who did their homework.

Around the same time, a different school of thought was taking shape. Charles Dow—founder of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and _The Wall Street Journal_—had already pioneered the idea that stock
price patterns themselves contained useful information. His followers believed you didn't need to
read a balance sheet if you could read a chart.

These two camps—fundamental analysis and technical analysis—have been arguing ever since. The Series
7 expects you to understand both, plus a third approach: portfolio analysis, which focuses not on
picking individual securities but on building the right combination of them.

### Why This Chapter Matters

This chapter ties together everything you've studied about individual securities. The question is no
longer "what is this product?"—it's "should a client buy it, and how does it fit into their
portfolio?" That shift from product knowledge to investment reasoning is exactly where the Series 7
lives.

---

## Topic 1: Technical Analysis

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>Charles Dow never actually called his ideas "technical analysis." He wrote a series of editorials in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> between 1900 and 1902 observing that stock prices moved in identifiable trends. After his death, followers compiled his observations into what became known as "Dow Theory"—the grandfather of every chart pattern, moving average, and trend line used today.</p>
</div>

<span class="key-term">Technical analysis</span> focuses on price trends to gauge where the market
or an individual security may be heading. Technical analysts—sometimes called "chartists"—believe
that all relevant information is already reflected in the price, so studying price movements is the
most efficient way to make investment decisions.

The core assumption: history tends to repeat itself. If a stock has bounced off a certain price
three times before, it might do so again.

---

### The Trend Line

A <span class="key-term">trend line</span> is the most basic tool in technical analysis. It connects
a series of prices over time to reveal the direction of movement.

- An <span class="key-term">uptrend</span> shows prices making higher highs and higher lows—the line
  slopes up from left to right
- A <span class="key-term">downtrend</span> shows prices making lower highs and lower lows—the line
  slopes down

The simplest question a technical analyst asks: "Is the trend your friend?" If a security is in an
established uptrend, technicians expect it to continue until something breaks the pattern.

---

### Seasons (Cyclical Patterns)

Patterns of up-and-down price movements that follow a repeating cycle are known as
<span class="key-term">seasons</span> or <span class="key-term">seasonal trends</span>. These are
recurring patterns that technical analysts use to time their trades.

Two classic seasonal chart shapes:

- **Saucer** — a U-shaped pattern where prices gradually decline, bottom out, and then gradually
  rise. This is considered a bullish reversal pattern.
- **Inverted Saucer** — an upside-down U where prices rise, top out, and then decline. This is a
  bearish reversal pattern.

---

### Support, Resistance, and Breakouts

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Resistance</strong> = the ceiling (price struggles to go higher)<br>
  <strong>Support</strong> = the floor (price struggles to go lower)<br>
  A <strong>breakout</strong> occurs when price pushes through either level.</p>
</div>

A <span class="key-term">resistance level</span> is a price point where a security repeatedly fails
to move higher. Think of it as a ceiling that the price keeps bumping against. Sellers tend to
emerge at this level, pushing the price back down.

A <span class="key-term">support level</span> is the opposite—a price floor where buyers
consistently step in, preventing the price from falling further.

When the price finally pushes through resistance, that's a
<span class="key-term">breakout</span>—generally considered bullish because the old ceiling has been
overcome. If the price breaks below support, the signal is bearish.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Once resistance is broken, it often becomes the new support level (and vice versa). This concept of "role reversal" shows up on exam questions.</p>
</div>

---

### Consolidating Market

A market that moves within a narrow range—bouncing between support and resistance without making
significant new highs or lows—is said to be <span class="key-term">consolidating</span>. This is
also called <span class="key-term">sideways movement</span>.

Consolidation often precedes a significant move in one direction. Technicians watch consolidating
markets closely because the eventual breakout (up or down) can be powerful.

---

### Head and Shoulders

The <span class="key-term">head and shoulders</span> pattern is one of the most recognized reversal
patterns in technical analysis. It signals a potential shift from bullish to bearish.

The pattern forms in three peaks:

1. **Left Shoulder** — price rises, then pulls back
2. **Head** — price rises higher than the first peak, then pulls back again
3. **Right Shoulder** — price rises to roughly the same level as the left shoulder, then declines

When the price drops below the "neckline" (the support level connecting the two pullback lows), the
pattern is confirmed. Technicians expect further decline.

---

### Reverse Head and Shoulders

The mirror image. If the market has been trending downward and forms a
<span class="key-term">reverse head and shoulders</span> (three troughs with the middle one
deepest), it signals a potential bullish reversal. The pattern is confirmed when price breaks above
the neckline.

---

### Moving Average

A <span class="key-term">moving average</span> smooths out short-term price fluctuations to reveal
longer-term trends. It's calculated by averaging a security's closing prices over a set number of
days.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <p>The <strong>200-day moving average</strong> is the most widely followed. When a stock's price crosses above its 200-day moving average, technicians interpret this as bullish. When it crosses below, it's bearish. Portfolio managers at major firms watch this level religiously—it's one of those self-fulfilling prophecies where enough people believe in it that it actually affects trading behavior.</p>
</div>

---

### Market Strength Indicators

Technical analysts don't just study individual stocks—they study the health of the market itself.
Several indicators help gauge market strength:

#### Short Interest Ratio

The <span class="key-term">short interest ratio</span> measures how many shares have been sold short
relative to average daily trading volume.

Here's the contrarian logic: a high short interest ratio is actually considered
<strong>bullish</strong>. Why? Because every short seller eventually has to buy shares to close
their position. All those short positions represent future buying pressure—a "short squeeze" waiting
to happen.

#### Odd Lot Theory

This is a classic <span class="key-term">contrarian indicator</span>. The theory holds that small
investors—those buying fewer than 100 shares (an "odd lot")—tend to be wrong at market turning
points.

- If odd lot purchases increase → contrarian view: <strong>bearish</strong> (small investors are
  buying near the top)
- If odd lot sales increase → contrarian view: <strong>bullish</strong> (small investors are selling
  near the bottom)

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> The odd lot theory and short interest ratio are both contrarian indicators. The exam loves to test whether you understand that these indicators say the <em>opposite</em> of what you might initially expect.</p>
</div>

#### Advance/Decline Index

The <span class="key-term">advance/decline index</span> measures market breadth—how many stocks are
participating in a market move. Each day, the number of advancing stocks minus declining stocks is
calculated and added to a running cumulative total.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Day</th><th>Advances</th><th>Declines</th><th>Net</th><th>Cumulative</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>600</td><td>1,400</td><td>-800</td><td>-800</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>800</td><td>1,200</td><td>-400</td><td>-1,200</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000</td><td>0</td><td>-1,200</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>A rising advance/decline line is bullish (broad market participation). A declining line is bearish (fewer stocks participating in the rally).</p>
</div>

#### Put/Call Ratio

The <span class="key-term">put/call ratio</span> compares the volume of put options purchased to
call options purchased. A high ratio (more puts than calls) means bearish sentiment prevails among
traders. Contrarian technicians interpret this as a <strong>bullish</strong> signal—when everyone is
pessimistic, the market is more likely to go up.

---

## Topic 2: Fundamental Analysis

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>When Benjamin Graham published <em>The Intelligent Investor</em> in 1949, he introduced a concept he called "Mr. Market"—an imaginary business partner who shows up every day offering to buy your shares or sell you his at a different price. Sometimes Mr. Market is euphoric and overpays. Sometimes he's depressed and offers bargains. Graham's insight was that you should take advantage of Mr. Market's mood swings, not be guided by them. His most famous student? Warren Buffett, who has called the book "by far the best book on investing ever written."</p>
</div>

<span class="key-term">Fundamental analysis</span> examines a company's financial statements to
determine its intrinsic value. Where technical analysts study price charts, fundamental analysts
study income statements and balance sheets. The goal: figure out whether a stock's current market
price is justified by the company's actual financial health.

---

### The Income Statement

The <span class="key-term">income statement</span> shows a company's financial performance over a
period of time—typically a quarter or a year. Think of it as a movie, not a photograph: it captures
what happened between two dates.

The flow works from top to bottom:

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Income Statement Structure</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">
    Gross Revenue (Sales)<br>
    − Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)<br>
    = <strong>Gross Profit</strong><br>
    − Operating Expenses (SGA, depreciation)<br>
    = <strong>EBIT (Operating Income)</strong><br>
    − Interest Expense<br>
    = <strong>EBT (Earnings Before Taxes)</strong><br>
    − Taxes<br>
    = <strong>Net Income</strong>
  </div>
</div>

#### Key Income Statement Terms

<span class="key-term">EBIT</span> (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) — also called operating
income. This shows how well the company's core business performs before financing costs and taxes
enter the picture. It's the purest measure of operational profitability.

<span class="key-term">EBITDA</span> — adds depreciation and amortization back to EBIT. Useful for
comparing companies with different capital structures and depreciation methods, because it strips
out non-cash charges.

<span class="key-term">EBT</span> (Earnings Before Taxes) — EBIT minus interest expense. This shows
profitability after all expenses except taxes.

<span class="key-term">Net Income</span> — the "bottom line." This is what's left after all
expenses, interest, and taxes. Net income is what's available to shareholders.

#### Earnings Per Share

<span class="key-term">Earnings Per Share (EPS)</span> is arguably the single most watched number in
all of corporate finance.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Basic EPS = Net Income ÷ Shares Outstanding</div>
</div>

If a company has convertible bonds, stock options, or warrants that could create additional shares,
it must also report <span class="key-term">fully diluted EPS</span>—which assumes all convertible
securities have been converted to common stock.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Fully diluted EPS will always be <em>equal to or lower than</em> basic EPS, never higher. More shares in the denominator = smaller number. The exam tests this concept frequently.</p>
</div>

---

### The Balance Sheet

The <span class="key-term">balance sheet</span> shows a company's financial position at a specific
point in time—a snapshot, not a movie. It answers one fundamental question: what does this company
own, what does it owe, and what's left for shareholders?

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity</strong><br>
  This equation must always balance. If it doesn't, someone is going to prison.</p>
</div>

**Assets** (what the company owns):

- <span class="key-term">Current Assets</span> — cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid
  expenses (convertible to cash within 12 months)
- <span class="key-term">Fixed Assets</span> — property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)
- <span class="key-term">Intangible Assets</span> — goodwill, patents, trademarks

**Liabilities** (what the company owes):

- <span class="key-term">Current Liabilities</span> — accounts payable, notes payable, accrued
  liabilities, wages payable (due within 12 months)
- <span class="key-term">Long-term Liabilities</span> — bonds, mortgages, long-term debt

**Shareholders' Equity** (what's left for owners):

- Common stock (par value) + Capital in excess of par + Retained earnings

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Real-World Example</div>
  <p>If a company's total equity is $1,528,000 and it has 100,000 shares outstanding, its <strong>book value per share</strong> is $15.28. If the stock trades at $25, the market is valuing the company at roughly 1.6× its book value—suggesting investors believe the company is worth more than its accounting value.</p>
</div>

---

### Measures of Liquidity

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations. The exam focuses on
three:

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Working Capital</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Working Capital = Current Assets − Current Liabilities</div>
</div>

Positive working capital means the company has enough short-term assets to cover short-term debts.
Negative working capital is a red flag.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Current Ratio</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities</div>
</div>

A current ratio above 1.0 means the company can cover its short-term debts. Higher is generally
better.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Quick Ratio (Acid Test)</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Quick Ratio = (Current Assets − Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities</div>
</div>

The <span class="key-term">quick ratio</span> (also called the <span class="key-term">acid
test</span>) is a more conservative measure. It strips out inventory because inventory can't always
be converted to cash quickly. If a company passes the acid test, it can meet short-term obligations
even without selling any inventory.

---

### Measures of Financial Leverage

Leverage ratios reveal how much debt a company carries relative to its equity and assets.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Debt-to-Equity Ratio</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt ÷ Total Equity</div>
</div>

Higher debt-to-equity = more leverage = more risk. A company financed primarily by debt is more
vulnerable in downturns because interest payments are mandatory regardless of profitability.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Debt Ratio</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Debt Ratio = Total Debt ÷ Total Assets</div>
</div>

A ratio above 0.5 means more than half of the company's assets are financed by debt.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Interest Coverage (Times Interest Earned)</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Interest Coverage = EBIT ÷ Annual Interest Expense</div>
</div>

This measures whether a company can comfortably pay the interest on its debt. A ratio of 5× means
the company earns five times its interest expense. Higher is better—and lenders pay very close
attention to this number.

---

### Inventory Valuation

How a company values its inventory affects its reported profits and tax liability. The exam tests
four methods:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Inventory Methods in a Rising Price Environment</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Method</th><th>COGS</th><th>Reported Profit</th><th>Taxes</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>FIFO</strong> (First In, First Out)</td><td>Lower</td><td>Higher</td><td>Higher</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>LIFO</strong> (Last In, First Out)</td><td>Higher</td><td>Lower</td><td>Lower</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Average Cost</strong></td><td>Middle</td><td>Middle</td><td>Middle</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Specific Identification</strong></td><td>Actual cost tracked per item</td><td>Varies</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> Remember "FIFO = Fatter Income" in a rising price environment. Because the oldest (cheapest) inventory is sold first, COGS is lower and profits appear higher. LIFO has the opposite effect.</p>
</div>

**Inventory Turnover** = COGS ÷ Average Inventory. Higher turnover means the company is selling
inventory more quickly—generally a sign of efficiency.

**Accounts Receivable Turnover** = Net Sales ÷ Average Accounts Receivable. Higher is better—the
company is collecting on credit sales more efficiently.

---

### Cash Flow Statement

The <span class="key-term">cash flow statement</span> tracks actual cash moving in and out of the
company. It has three sections:

1. **Operating Activities** — cash from day-to-day business operations
2. **Investing Activities** — cash from buying/selling assets and investments
3. **Financing Activities** — cash from issuing stock, paying dividends, borrowing

A company can report positive net income but still have negative cash flow (and vice versa). The
cash flow statement reveals the truth behind the accounting.

---

### Valuation Ratios

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">P/E = Market Price per Share ÷ Earnings Per Share</div>
</div>

The <span class="key-term">P/E ratio</span> is the most widely used valuation metric in the market.
A high P/E may indicate the stock is overvalued—or that investors expect strong future growth. A low
P/E may indicate undervaluation—or that the company's prospects are dim.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">P/B = Market Price per Share ÷ Book Value per Share</div>
</div>

A P/B ratio above 1.0 means the market values the company above its accounting (book) value. Most
healthy, growing companies trade above book value.

#### Financial Footnotes

Don't skip the footnotes. Financial statement footnotes can reveal accounting methods used,
contingent liabilities, related-party transactions, and off-balance-sheet items. On the exam—and in
real life—the footnotes can completely change your interpretation of the numbers.

---

## Topic 3: Portfolio Analysis

<div class="historical-note">
  <div class="historical-note__label">Historical Context</div>
  <p>In 1952, a 25-year-old graduate student named Harry Markowitz published a 14-page paper called "Portfolio Selection" in <em>The Journal of Finance</em>. His insight was deceptively simple: investors should evaluate securities not in isolation but in the context of their entire portfolio. Diversification wasn't just common sense—it could be mathematically optimized. That paper earned him a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990 and launched the entire field of modern portfolio theory.</p>
</div>

Portfolio analysis shifts the focus from individual securities to how those securities work
together. The central question: how do you build a portfolio that maximizes return for a given level
of risk?

---

### Systematic vs. Nonsystematic Risk

<div class="critical-concept">
  <div class="critical-concept__label">MEMORIZE THIS</div>
  <p><strong>Nonsystematic risk</strong> (company-specific, diversifiable) — can be reduced by adding more positions to a portfolio.<br>
  <strong>Systematic risk</strong> (market risk, non-diversifiable) — cannot be diversified away. It affects the entire market.</p>
</div>

If your portfolio holds only one stock, a single piece of bad news can devastate its value. That's
<span class="key-term">nonsystematic risk</span>—risk that's specific to a company or industry. Add
more positions across different sectors and this risk shrinks.

But no amount of diversification eliminates <span class="key-term">systematic risk</span>. When
interest rates rise, nearly all bond prices fall. When the economy enters a recession, most stocks
decline. That's market-wide risk, and it's always present.

---

### Beta

<span class="key-term">Beta</span> measures the correlation between a security's price movement and
the overall market (typically the S&P 500, which has a beta of 1.0).

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Beta Quick Reference</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Beta</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Example</th></tr>
    <tr><td>&gt; 1.0</td><td>More volatile than the market</td><td>High-tech stocks (beta ~1.2)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>= 1.0</td><td>Moves in line with the market</td><td>Broad market index fund</td></tr>
    <tr><td>&lt; 1.0</td><td>Less volatile than the market</td><td>Utility companies (beta ~0.8)</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

A stock with a beta of 1.2 is expected to be 20% more volatile than the market. If the market rises
10%, that stock should rise about 12%. If the market drops 10%, expect a 12% decline.

<div class="test-tip">
  <p><strong>Test Tip:</strong> High beta = high risk = high expected return. Conservative clients should hold lower-beta portfolios. Aggressive growth investors tolerate higher betas.</p>
</div>

---

### CAPM and the Risk Premium

The <span class="key-term">Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</span> provides a framework for
calculating the expected return on a security.

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">CAPM Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × (Market Return − Risk-Free Rate)</div>
</div>

The <span class="key-term">risk-free rate</span> is typically the Treasury bill rate. The difference
between the market return and the risk-free rate is the <span class="key-term">risk
premium</span>—the additional return investors demand for taking on market risk.

Investors expect higher returns from high-risk stocks (high beta) and accept lower returns from
safer investments (low beta). CAPM quantifies this relationship.

---

### Alpha

<span class="key-term">Alpha</span> measures the difference between a security's actual return and
its expected return (as predicted by CAPM).

<div class="calculation-box">
  <div class="calculation-box__label">Formula</div>
  <div class="calculation-box__formula">Alpha = Actual Return − Expected Return</div>
</div>

- **Positive alpha**: the investment outperformed expectations. A fund manager who consistently
  generates positive alpha is "beating the market."
- **Negative alpha**: the investment underperformed expectations.

This is the heart of the active vs. passive management debate. Active managers believe skilled
analysis can generate positive alpha. Passive investors argue that after fees and taxes, most active
managers fail to deliver it consistently—which is why index funds exist.

(Whether those fees are worth paying is a debate that has filled more financial journals than anyone
will ever read, and launched at least one very successful index fund company in a suburb outside
Philadelphia.)

---

### Asset Allocation Strategies

Once you've analyzed individual securities, the next step is deciding how to allocate across asset
classes. The exam covers two main approaches:

#### Strategic Asset Allocation

<span class="key-term">Strategic asset allocation</span> sets target percentages for each asset
class based on the investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Sample Strategic Allocation</div>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Asset Class</th><th>Target</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Maximum</th></tr>
    <tr><td>U.S. Government T-Bills</td><td>20%</td><td>5%</td><td>50%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Corporate Bonds</td><td>30%</td><td>15%</td><td>50%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Large-Company Stocks</td><td>50%</td><td>25%</td><td>75%</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>The minimum and maximum ranges allow tactical adjustments based on market conditions—without letting the manager go all-in on a single bet.</p>
</div>

#### Tactical Asset Allocation

Within the strategic framework, a manager can make <span class="key-term">tactical
adjustments</span>—shifting weights toward asset classes that appear undervalued or away from those
that appear overvalued. The minimum/maximum constraints prevent extreme positions.

---

### Active vs. Passive Management

<span class="key-term">Active management</span> relies on fundamental analysis to identify
undervalued securities within each asset class. The goal is to generate returns above the benchmark
(positive alpha). The trade-off: higher fees, higher transaction costs, and potential tax
consequences from frequent trading.

<span class="key-term">Passive management</span> accepts that markets are generally efficient and
uses index funds to match market returns at minimal cost. No attempt is made to beat the market—just
to capture its returns with the lowest possible expenses.

Two common passive rebalancing methods:

<div class="info-box">
  <div class="info-box__title">Passive Rebalancing Plans</div>
  <p><strong>Constant Dollar Plan:</strong> A fixed dollar amount is allocated to equities. If equities rise above this amount, the excess is transferred to bonds. If equities fall below, bonds are liquidated to buy equities back to the target dollar amount.</p>
  <p><strong>Constant Ratio Plan:</strong> A fixed <em>percentage</em> is allocated to equities. As prices change, the portfolio is rebalanced to maintain the target percentage across asset classes.</p>
</div>

---

### Investment Styles

The exam also covers several distinct approaches to equity selection:

#### Indexing

Using index funds that mirror a broad market benchmark (S&P 500, S&P 400 Mid Cap, etc.) to achieve
diversification efficiently. The premise: markets are efficient, so trying to beat them wastes time
and money.

#### Growth Investing

Selecting stocks based primarily on earnings growth or stock price momentum. Growth investors seek
companies whose earnings are growing faster than the market average, often accepting higher
valuations in exchange for higher expected growth.

#### Value Investing

Selecting stocks that appear <span class="key-term">fundamentally undervalued</span> relative to
their peers. Value investors examine P/E ratios, price-to-book ratios, and other fundamentals to
find solid companies that are temporarily out of favor. The expectation: over time, the market will
recognize the company's true worth and the stock price will rise to reflect it.
