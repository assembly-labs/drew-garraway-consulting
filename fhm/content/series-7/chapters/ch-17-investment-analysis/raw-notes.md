## Introduction to Securities Analysis

Three basic methods used in securities analysis:

- **Technical analysis** - focuses on price trends to gauge where the market or an individual
  security may be heading in the near future
- **Fundamental analysis** - looks at a company's "fundamentals" to determine its current and
  potential future value
- **Portfolio analysis** - used to determine the best combination of securities for a given investor
  and to compare the performance of different money managers

## Key Concepts

After finishing this section, should be familiar with:

- Technical Analysis
- Fundamental Analysis
- Portfolio Analysis

---

## Topic 1: Technical Analysis

### The Trend Line

- Technical analysts rely on charts to predict future movements. Charting patterns are used to make
  decisions.
- A **trend line** is used to predict the direction of a security's movement
- Charts show price vs. time
- An **uptrend** shows increasing prices over time (line goes up-left to right)
- A **downtrend** shows decreasing prices over time (line goes down-left to right)

### Seasons

- Patterns of up-and-down movements that follow a repeating cycle are known as **seasons**
- If a prior pattern has established itself, the market is said to follow **seasonal trends** (stock
  prices go up and down in a pattern)
- An **inverted saucer** pattern curves up and then back down
- A **saucer** pattern curves down and then back up

### Resistance Level, Support Level and Breakouts

- A **resistance level** is a point where the market repeatedly tests a high price but fails to
  break through. This is the "ceiling"
- A **support level** is a point where the market repeatedly tests a low price but fails to break
  below. This is the "floor"
- If the market price breaks through a resistance level, it may keep rising (**breakout** upward)
- If the market price breaks through a support level, this is considered bearish (breakout downward)

### Consolidating Market

- A market that moves within a narrow range with no major upward or downward movement is said to be
  **consolidating** (also called "sideways movement")

### Head and Shoulders

- A bearish pattern that indicates a potential downturn
- Looks like a "head and shoulders" top formation: the market rises (left shoulder), rises higher
  (head), then rises to about the same level as the first peak (right shoulder), then declines
- This is a **reversal pattern** - signals a shift from bullish to bearish

### Reverse Head and Shoulders

- If the market has been trending downward and forms a **reverse head and shoulders** pattern, it is
  considered bullish
- This is the inverse of head and shoulders: dips (left shoulder), dips deeper (head), dips to about
  the first level (right shoulder), then rises

### Moving Average

- A graph or report of the past average prices over a specified time period
- Used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends
- Common periods: **200-day moving average** is very popular
- Helps identify the overall direction the stock is moving

### Market Strength

- Technical analysts use various indicators to determine the "strength" of the market
- If new issues are being actively traded, it indicates that investors believe that there are new
  investment opportunities
- Conversely, if few new issues are being issued, the market is not expected to do well
- If mutual funds are not issuing shares, the market is considered weak or speculative

### Available Funds

- If cash positions held by institutions are high (lots of available funds), the market is
  considered bullish (money waiting to come into market)
- If funds have cash substantially lower, investors have put money into the market, potentially
  indicating it is fully valued (bullish pressure exhausted)

### Short Interest Ratio

- The **short interest ratio** is the number of shares that have been sold short by the average
  daily trading volume
- If short interest ratio is high (lots of shares sold short), this is considered **bullish** by
  contrarian technicians
- More than 100 shares are often involved; if a lot of investors are shorting, it's best to go in
  opposite direction

### Odd Lot Theory

- This is a **contrarian indicator**
- Small investors (those buying fewer than 100 shares — "odd lots") are assumed to be wrong
- If odd lot purchases increase, a technical analyst would consider this **bearish** (small
  investors are buying = market is near a top)
- If odd lot sales increase, considered **bullish** (small investors selling = market is near a
  bottom)

### Advance/Decline Index

- Measures the overall direction of the stock market
- Tracks number of stocks that have advanced (increased in price) vs. declined (decreased in price)
- Advance/decline index is net: advances minus declines
- Example table:
  - Day 1: 600 advances, 1400 declines → Net = -800
  - Day 2: 800 advances, 1200 declines → Net = -400
  - Day 3: 1000 advances, 1000 declines → Net = 0 (cumulative: -1200)

### Advance/Decline Line

- Another measure of breadth: a chart "advance/decline line"
- To draw the line: each day add net advances/declines to the cumulative total
- A rising advance/decline line is bullish; declining is bearish

### Put/Call Ratio

- Technicians also evaluate option activity. If there are a lot of put buyers relative to call
  buyers, the contrarian view is **bullish**
- High put/call ratio = bearish sentiment among traders = contrarian bullish signal

## Topic 2: Fundamental Analysis

### Overview

- Fundamental analysts look at a company's financial statements to determine its intrinsic value
- They examine the company's income statement and balance sheet
- Key question: Is the current stock price fairly valued based on the company's financial health?

### The Income Statement

Income statement represents the financial performance over a period (quarter, year).

**Income Statement Structure:**

|                             | Millions | Monthly |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Gross Revenue (Sales)       |          |         |
| - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) |          |         |
| = **Gross Profit**          |          |         |

#### Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)

- Also called **operating income** or **operating profit**
- EBIT = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses (SGA, depreciation, amortization)
- EBIT shows how well the company's core business is performing before financing costs and taxes
- Sometimes called **EBITDA** if depreciation and amortization are added back (used to compare
  companies in different capital structures)
- A company that can cover its interest expense from EBIT is in a stronger position

#### Earnings Before Taxes (EBT)

- EBT = EBIT - Interest Expense
- EBT shows profitability after all expenses except taxes

#### Net Income

- Net Income = EBT - Taxes
- This is the "bottom line"
- Net income is what is available to common shareholders (after preferred dividends)

#### EBITDA

- EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
- Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures and depreciation methods

#### Diluted Earnings Per Share

- Basic EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding
- If a company has convertible bonds or options that could be converted to shares, must report
  **fully diluted EPS**
- This accounts for the potential increase in shares

#### Fully Diluted Earnings Per Share

- If all convertible securities converted to stock, EPS would decrease ("dilution")
- Uses: Net Income / (Outstanding shares + potentially converted shares)
- The fully diluted EPS will always be lower than or equal to basic EPS

### The Balance Sheet

Balance Sheet shows a company's financial position at a **specific point in time** (snapshot).

**Fundamental equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

| Assets            | Liabilities + Equity                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Current Assets    | Current Liabilities                      |
| Fixed Assets      | Long-Term Liabilities                    |
| Intangible Assets | Shareholders' Equity                     |
|                   | (Common + Preferred + Retained Earnings) |

**Key balance sheet items:**

**Assets side:** | Item | Description | |---|---| | Cash | Most liquid asset | | Accounts Receivable
| Money owed to the company | | Inventory | Goods for sale | | Prepaid Expenses | Paid in advance |
| Fixed Assets | PP&E (Property, Plant, Equipment) | | Intangible Assets | Goodwill, patents,
trademarks |

**Liabilities + Equity side:** | Item | Description | |---|---| | Accounts Payable | Money owed to
suppliers | | Notes Payable | Short-term borrowing | | Accrued Liabilities | Expenses incurred not
yet paid | | Wages Payable | Salaries owed | | Long-term Debt | Bonds, mortgages | | Preferred Stock
| Par value of preferred shares | | Common Stock | Par value of common shares | | Capital in excess
of par | Additional paid-in capital | | Retained Earnings | Accumulated profits not distributed |

Example: Equity per share = Total equity / shares outstanding. If total equity = $1,528,000 and
shares = 100,000 → Book value = $15.28/share

#### Current Assets and Liabilities

- Current assets: cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses
- Current = can be converted to cash (or will come due) within 12 months
- **Liquid assets**: assets that can be easily converted to cash with minimal loss of value (cash,
  marketable securities, accounts receivable)

#### Current Liabilities

- Liabilities due within 12 months
- Includes: accounts payable, notes payable, accrued liabilities, wages payable, taxes payable
- **Trade payables** = money owed to suppliers
- **Notes payable** = formal short-term borrowing

#### Measures of Liquidity

**Working Capital:**

- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- Measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations
- Positive working capital = more current assets than current liabilities (good)

**Current Ratio:**

- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- A ratio above 1.0 means the company can cover short-term debts
- Higher is better (more liquid)
- Example: if current assets = $500K and current liabilities = $250K, current ratio = 2.0

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test):**

- Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- More conservative than current ratio
- Excludes inventory because it may not be easily convertible to cash
- Also called the **acid test ratio**

#### Measures of Financial Leverage

**Leverage Ratio (Debt-to-Equity):**

- Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
- Measures how much of the company is financed by debt vs. equity
- Higher ratio = more leveraged = more risk

**Debt Ratio:**

- Debt Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets
- Also called **debt service ratio** (how much of the total assets are financed by debt)
- A ratio above 0.5 means more than half the company's assets are debt-financed

**Interest Coverage Ratio:**

- Interest Coverage = EBIT / Annual Interest Expense
- Measures ability to pay interest on outstanding debt
- Higher is better (company can easily cover interest payments)
- AKA "times interest earned"

#### Inventory

**Inventory valuation methods:**

- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** oldest inventory sold first. In rising price environment, COGS is
  lower, profits are higher, taxes are higher
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** newest inventory sold first. In rising price environment, COGS is
  higher, profits are lower, taxes are lower
- **Average cost:** weighted average of all inventory. Middle ground between FIFO and LIFO
- **Specific identification:** tracks actual cost of each item

**Inventory Turnover:**

- Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
- Measures how quickly inventory is sold
- Higher turnover = more efficient

#### Accounts Receivable Turnover

- AR Turnover = Net Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
- Measures how efficiently a company collects on credit sales
- Higher is better

#### Cash Flow Statement, Valuation Ratios, and Financial Notes

**Cash Flow Statement** has three sections:

1. **Cash from operating activities** (day-to-day business)
2. **Cash from investing activities** (buying/selling assets, investments)
3. **Cash from financing activities** (issuing stock, paying dividends, borrowing)

#### Valuation Ratios

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:**

- P/E = Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share
- Most widely used valuation metric
- Higher P/E may indicate stock is overvalued or investors expect high growth
- Forward P/E uses estimated future earnings

**Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:**

- P/B = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
- Book value = total equity / shares outstanding
- P/B > 1 means market values company above its accounting value

#### Footnotes

- Financial statements include footnotes that provide additional details
- Footnotes can reveal: accounting methods, contingent liabilities, related-party transactions,
  off-balance-sheet items
- Always read the footnotes — they can change the interpretation of the numbers

## Topic 3: Portfolio Analysis

### Systematic and Nonsystematic Risks

- If a portfolio has only a handful of stocks, negative news about one stock can have an outsized
  negative impact on the portfolio's value (**nonsystematic risk**, also called diversifiable or
  company-specific risk)
- As more positions are added, this company-specific risk is diversified away, leaving the portfolio
  with only **systematic risk** (also called market risk or non-diversifiable risk)
- Systematic risk also applies to debt markets (e.g., rising interest rates = lower bond prices,
  across the board)
- Systematic risk CANNOT be diversified away — it's inherent to the entire market

### Beta

- Beta measures the **correlation** between a single security's price movement and the market as a
  whole
- The market benchmark (S&P 500) has a beta of **1.0**
- Beta > 1.0 = more volatile than the market
- Beta < 1.0 = less volatile than the market
- Beta = 1.0 = moves in line with the market

Examples:

- Stock with beta of 1.2 → expected to be 20% more volatile than the market
- **High beta** stocks: high-tech companies
- Stocks expected to be 20% less volatile: beta = 0.8
- **Low beta** stocks: utility companies

### Introduction to Premium

- Under the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**, the expected return for a security is the
  risk-free rate plus a risk premium
- Risk-free rate = T-bill rate (or T-note rate)
- Risk premium: the additional return investors require above the risk-free rate for taking on
  market risk
- Investors expect a higher rate of return for high-risk stocks compared to a utility company

### Alpha

- Expectations are based on past performance, but past performance is not always a reliable
  indicator of future returns
- The difference between a security's actual return and its expected return is the stock's **alpha**
- **Alpha = actual return - expected return**
- Alpha > 0: the stock performed better than expected (positive alpha = good)
- Alpha < 0: performed worse than expected
- Alpha can also be used to measure performance of mutual funds
  - Active investors believe that portfolio managers can outperform the market and will generate
    positive alpha
  - Passive investors believe that money managers cannot consistently outperform and would invest in
    index funds

### Asset Allocation

- Once individual securities have been analyzed, the next step is constructing a suitable portfolio
  through various **asset allocation** strategies

### Strategic Asset Allocation

- Process of selecting a "target" asset allocation — the percentage to be invested in different
  types of securities
- Example target: U.S. Government/Treasury bills 20%, Long-term corporate bonds 30%, Large-company
  stocks 50%
- The proportion of assets in each class is termed the "portfolio balance" or the "normal asset
  allocation"

| Asset Class             | Target | Minimum | Maximum |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| U.S. Government T-bills | 20%    | 5%      | 50%     |
| Corporate Bonds         | 30%    | 15%     | 50%     |
| Large-Company Stocks    | 50%    | 25%     | 75%     |

- The idea behind the "tactical" minimum and maximum percentages is that it allows the manager to
  shift portfolio emphasis based on market conditions
- Example: if equities are performing strongly, the manager may shift portfolio to 40% equities from
  50% target while reducing corporate bonds
- This prevents the manager from "betting the ranch" on 100% equities

### Active Asset Management

- Based on the belief that fundamental analysis performed by an analyst can identify undervalued
  securities and produce a superior return within a given asset class
- Involves strategy to find inefficiencies in the market pricing of specific securities
- Performing this strategic experience: the returns must be large enough to cover expenses and yield
  a net profit
- Additionally, the shifting of the portfolio will generate tax events, which could add an
  additional layer of costs

### Passive Asset Management

- Based on the belief that the market is efficient in pricing securities
- An index fund can be used for each asset class, providing desired diversification with minimal
  annual expenses
- Indexing is a low-cost and low-effort method of portfolio construction

#### Formulas for passive management:

- **Constant Dollar Plan:** A fixed dollar amount is allocated to equity securities. If portfolio
  value exceeds this amount, the excess is transferred to debt instruments. If equity drops below
  the fixed amount, debt is liquidated to buy equities back to the constant dollar amount.
  - Example: constant dollar allocation of $100,000 to equities. If portfolio increases to $110,000
    → $10,000 transferred out of equity to debt. If drops below $100,000 → buy more equity from
    debt.

- **Constant Ratio Plan:** A fixed percentage of all assets is allocated to equity securities. If
  equities rise beyond the limit, equities are liquidated and used to buy debt. If equities fall
  below, debt is liquidated to buy equities.

### Other Investment Strategies

#### Indexing

- Another factor in security selection is the use of indexed securities
- This goes back to diversification: by using broad index funds that match the overall market
- Examples: Standard & Poor's 500 Index funds, S&P 400 Mid Cap funds, S&P 250 Small Cap funds
- Investing using broad investment index account markets are inherently efficient; there is no point
  in spending time and money trying to "beat the market"

#### Growth Investing

- Growth investing means selecting equity investments based solely on their earnings growth or stock
  price growth over time
- Growth investing ignores fundamental and technical factors
- If earnings growth or stock price growth is expected to outpace that of the market, investment in
  those securities should yield superior returns
- Of course the methodology for choosing these "superior" investments is key to the success
- Not based on historical data; it is not necessarily predictive of future outcomes
- As with all such predictive strategies, it tends not to yield superior results over a long time
  frame

#### Value Investing

- Value investing is the selection of equity investments based on finding securities that are
  fundamentally undervalued in the marketplace
- These tend to be solid companies that are currently out of favor
- Value investors look at such fundamental factors as: the price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book
  value ratio to find companies that are undervalued relative to their peers
- Then, value investors research and look at such factors as: current products, new products,
  management, market share, and industry outlook
- Those companies that are expected to perform well over the long term at these low prices would be
  selected as good values
- Over time, the market should recognize the fundamental worth of these companies and bring the
  price of the shares up to current market multiples

## Summary of Securities Analysis

Important points to remember:

- **Technical analysis:** Trend line, head and shoulders, odd lot theory, advance/decline index
- **Fundamental analysis:** Income statement, balance sheet, assets and liabilities, cash flow
  statement
- **Portfolio analysis:** CAPM, beta, asset management
