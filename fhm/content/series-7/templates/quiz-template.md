### Question 2 (Calculation Example)

An investor buys 1 XYZ Jan 50 call at $4. At expiration, XYZ is trading at $58. What is the
investor's profit or loss?

A) $400 profit B) $400 loss C) $800 profit D) $800 loss

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct: A) $400 profit**

**Calculation:**

1. Premium paid: $4 × 100 shares = $400
2. Intrinsic value at expiration: ($58 - $50) × 100 = $800
3. Profit = $800 - $400 = **$400**

**Why the others are wrong:**

- B) This would be the result if the option expired worthless
- C) $800 is the intrinsic value, not the profit (forgot to subtract cost)
- D) There's no scenario where this is a loss—the option is in the money

**Key Concept:** Always subtract the premium paid from the exercise value.

### Question 3 (Scenario Example)

A 68-year-old retired teacher with moderate income and conservative investment objectives wants to
invest $50,000. Which recommendation is MOST suitable?

A) High-yield corporate bonds B) Index annuity C) Investment-grade municipal bonds D) Growth stock
mutual fund

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct: C) Investment-grade municipal bonds**

For a conservative, retired investor in a moderate tax bracket:

- Tax-exempt income is valuable
- Investment-grade reduces default risk
- Fixed income suits conservative objectives
- No surrender charges or complexity of annuities

**Why the others are wrong:**

- A) High-yield bonds are too risky for conservative investors
- B) Annuities have surrender charges problematic at age 68
- D) Growth stocks don't match conservative objectives

**Key Concept:** Match investments to customer profile (age, risk tolerance, objectives, tax
situation).
