# Chapter 1: Equities - Section 1: Common Stock Basics

## Introduction to Common Stock Basics

Companies can finance their operation in one of two ways:
- **Equity financing** (issuing stock)
- **Debt financing** (issuing bonds)

The term "stock" typically refers to **common stock**. Common stock is an ownership interest (equity) in an issuing corporation. Stock owners share in the benefits and rights of ownership, so we call it a "share of stock."

Types of common stocks range from relatively safe (defensive) issues to up-and-coming (but riskier) technology issues.

## Key Concepts

After finishing this section, you should be familiar with:
- **Common Stock Terms**

## Topic 1: Common Stock Terms

### Common Stock Is Equity

A **common stockholder (shareholder)** is an owner of a piece of a corporation. Owners are considered to have **equity** in the company.

In addition to corporations, investment companies such as mutual funds also issue common stock. Common stockholders hope to share in the growth of the company, which will be reflected in the share price.

### Authorized Stock and Par Value

When a corporation is formed, its corporate charter authorizes that a fixed number of common shares may be issued. This is called **authorized stock**.

The stock is assigned an arbitrary **par value**. For example, common stock might be assigned a par value of $1 per share.

> **Important:** Par value for common stock has **no bearing on the market price** of the stock - it is simply used for accounting purposes. Market value is based on investor expectations about the future of the company.

---

### Issued Stock

To raise capital needed to finance a corporation, the company will **issue stock**.

A corporation does not need to issue all its authorized shares right away. It sells only part of the authorized amount to the public so that it can sell more shares later (without having to amend its corporate charter).

**Example:**
- Corporation authorized to sell: 1,000,000 common shares
- Corporation issues: 400,000 shares
- Remaining unissued: 600,000 shares

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              1,000,000 Authorized Shares                │
├────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┤
│    400,000             │         600,000                │
│    Issued Shares       │         Unissued Shares        │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Outstanding Shares

Once issued, the shares are said to be **outstanding**. The corporation now has 400,000 **shares outstanding** (also termed outstanding shares) that can be traded between investors.

#### Market Capitalization

The number of shares outstanding times the current market price is used to find the company's **market capitalization** (market cap).

**Formula:**
```
Market Cap = Shares Outstanding × Market Price per Share
```

**Example:**
- 400,000 shares outstanding × $10 per share = **$4 million market cap**

---

### Treasury Stock

After issuance, the corporation may choose to **buy back** some of these previously issued shares. Repurchased shares are called **treasury stock** or **treasury shares**.

**Example after repurchasing 100,000 shares:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   1,000,000 Authorized Shares                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬─┤
│              400,000 Issued Shares                             │ │
├──────────────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────────────┤ │
│  300,000             │    100,000      │      600,000          │ │
│  Outstanding Shares  │ Treasury Shares │   Unissued Shares     │ │
└──────────────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────────┴─┘
```

#### Why Companies Buy Back Stock

The company may choose to:
- **Resell treasury stock** in the future to finance an acquisition of another company
- Use the stock for an **employee stock purchase plan**
- **Boost earnings per share (EPS)** - purchasing shares in the secondary market reduces outstanding shares, so earnings are divided among fewer shares
- Repurchase stock if they have excess cash and believe their outstanding shares are trading below actual worth (a **stock buyback**)

#### Key Differences: Treasury Stock vs. Outstanding Shares

| Feature | Common Shares (Outstanding) | Treasury Shares |
|---------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Voting Rights | **Yes** - right to vote on issues | **No** - no voting rights |
| Dividend Rights | **Yes** - right to receive dividends | **No** - no dividend rights |

---

### Transfer Agents and Registrars

Corporations hire **transfer agents** and **registrars** (often within the same company) to maintain ownership records.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Transfer Agent** | Records changes of ownership, cancels and issues certificates, maintains a list of shareholders |
| **Registrar** | Audits and oversees the transfer agent, verifies shareholder information |
| **Paying Agent** | Handles distributions such as dividends (also typically in the same company) |

---

### Regular Way Settlement

#### Listed vs. Over-the-Counter Securities

Equity securities can be traded on an exchange (**listed**) or **over-the-counter (unlisted)**.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Listed** | Must meet stringent listing standards | New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq |
| **Over-the-Counter (OTC)** | Typically smaller companies that do not meet exchange requirements | Unlisted securities |

#### Execution vs. Settlement

| Event | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Execution** | Trade occurs; buyer immediately becomes the **economic owner** and takes on the risk of the price rising or falling |
| **Settlement** | Securities and purchase price officially change hands; buyer becomes the **owner of record** |

#### Regular Way Settlement Timeline

When a trade is executed in an equity or equity-related security, settlement occurs **1 business day after the trade date**. This is called:

- **T+1 settlement**
- Also known as **regular way settlement**
