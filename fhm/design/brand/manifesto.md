# Franklin Hugh Money
## An Investment in Knowledge

---

## Purpose

Franklin Hugh Money exists to document one individual's journey from financial confusion to, hopefully, financial independence. Named after Benjamin Franklin (whose wisdom on compound interest remains evergreen) and Hugh (a family name that conveniently completes the acronym), this project chronicles the patient accumulation of wealth through remarkably boring methods.

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

**Simplicity Over Complexity**
The best investment strategy fits on an index card. The financial industry exists largely to convince you otherwise.

**Time Over Timing**
Success in investing comes from time in the market, not timing the market. Though everyone thinks they're the exception.

**Costs Matter**
A 2% fee doesn't sound like much until you realize it's 25% of your expected returns. Compounded over decades, that's the difference between retiring at 60 or 70.

**Documentation Helps**
Writing down what you're doing forces clarity. Publishing it creates accountability. Even if no one reads it.

## Approach

### What This Is
- A real-time documentation of building wealth
- Actual numbers (suitably anonymized)
- Lessons learned from predictable mistakes
- Observations on the peculiar nature of modern finance

### What This Isn't
- Financial advice (I'm not qualified)
- A get-rich-quick scheme (those don't work)
- Revolutionary insights (there aren't any)
- A sales pitch (nothing to sell)

## Method

The investment strategy employed here would disappoint anyone seeking excitement:

1. **Live below my means** - Spend less than I earn, revolutionary concept
2. **Invest the difference** - In low-cost index funds
3. **Wait** - The hardest part
4. **Document the journey** - For science, or masochism

This approach has been validated by decades of academic research and requires no special skill, which may explain why the financial services industry rarely mentions it.

---

## Audience

This documentation is for:

- **My future self** - To remember why I made certain decisions
- **The curious** - Who wonder what patient investing actually looks like
- **The skeptical** - Who think the system is rigged (it partly is)
- **Fellow travelers** - On their own journey to financial independence

---

## Tone

The writing here aims to be:

- **Clear** - Financial concepts without the jargon
- **Honest** - Including the failures and doubts
- **Occasionally amusing** - Because compound interest alone is rather dry
- **Never preachy** - Everyone's situation differs

---

## Disclaimer

Nothing here constitutes financial advice. These are simply the documented decisions of one person attempting to build wealth through index fund investing. Your mileage will vary. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. All the standard warnings apply, plus a few they haven't thought of yet.

## The Name

Yes, Franklin Hugh Money spells what you think it spells. No, we don't mention it explicitly. Yes, that's the joke. No, it's not that funny. Yes, it makes me smile anyway.

The beauty is that it works on multiple levels:
- **Franklin**: America's original personal finance guru
- **Hugh**: Family heritage (and fortunate spelling)
- **Money**: What this is ultimately about

---

## Progress

Success will be measured in:
- **Dollars accumulated** - The obvious metric
- **Lessons learned** - The valuable metric
- **Peace of mind** - The real metric
- **Years to independence** - The motivating metric

Questions, observations, and gentle corrections welcome at [appropriate contact]. Aggressive financial advice, cryptocurrency schemes, and multi-level marketing opportunities less so.

---

## In Summary

This is one person's attempt to document the slow, boring, surprisingly effective process of building wealth through index fund investing. It's not exciting, rarely dramatic, and occasionally educational.

But it works. Which is more than most financial strategies can claim.
