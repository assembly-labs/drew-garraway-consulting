multiple levels:

## 1. Core Identity

### What FHM Is

A personal finance documentation project chronicling one individual's journey toward financial
independence through disciplined investing and careful study.

### How FHM Sounds

> "Like an educated friend explaining their investment strategy over coffee—clear, approachable,
> occasionally insightful."

---

## 2. Voice Principles

### The 90/10 Rule (CRITICAL)

- **90%** straightforward, useful financial content
- **10%** clever observations that reward attention

This ratio is non-negotiable. Content should primarily be helpful and clear, with wit as a garnish
rather than the main course.

### Primary Voice Characteristics

| Characteristic                  | Description                      | Example                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conversational Professional** | Smart but not stuffy             | "Think of it as crowdfunding for Wall Street, except it predates that term by about 90 years." |
| **Modern Language**             | Current without being trendy     | Use "portfolio" not "bag"                                                                      |
| **Personal Experience**         | Real stories without oversharing | "I spent six months researching the perfect portfolio allocation."                             |
| **Quietly Confident**           | Knowledgeable without arrogance  | State facts, don't preach                                                                      |

## 3. Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

- Mostly simple and direct
- Occasional complex thoughts for nuance
- Natural rhythm—vary length for readability

### Modern but Literate

Write like someone who reads widely but explains simply.

**Good Examples:**

- "I invest $2,000 monthly in VTSAX."
- "The market dropped 30% in March 2020. I kept buying."
- "My financial advisor charged 1.5% annually to underperform a robot."

**Avoid:**

- Overly formal language
- Forced historical references
- British affectations
- Excessive cleverness

### Word Choices

**Words We Use:**

- Portfolio, investment, returns
- Strategy, approach, method
- Interesting, notable, worth considering
- Research, data, evidence

**Words We Avoid:**

- Crushing it, killing it, winning
- Guru, expert, genius
- Revolutionary, disruptive
- Obviously, clearly (condescending)
- Any profanity

---

## 4. Humor Deployment

### The "Exactly One Per Page" Rule

Each page/section gets ONE moment of wit, placed naturally. No more.

### Where Humor Works

- End of sections (as payoff)
- Photo captions
- Footnotes
- Parenthetical asides
- Natural transitions

### Humor Style

| Type                 | Description                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Observational**    | Notice absurdities without dwelling      | "Whether those decisions add value after fees is a debate that has launched a thousand academic papers and at least one very successful index fund company in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania." |
| **Self-deprecating** | Admit mistakes without self-flagellation | "I spent six months researching the perfect portfolio allocation. Turns out 'buy everything' works just fine."                                                                             |
| **Understated**      | The best jokes don't announce themselves | "This approach has been validated by decades of academic research and requires no special skill, which may explain why the financial industry rarely mentions it."                         |
| **Smart**            | Assume intelligent readers               | References to specific companies, events, or concepts without over-explaining                                                                                                              |

## 5. Content Opening Strategy

### The "No Definition First" Rule

Never start with a definition. Start with:

- A story
- A historical moment
- A "why it matters" statement
- A compelling fact

**Bad Opening:**

> "Municipal bonds are debt securities issued by state and local governments."

**Good Opening:**

> "Before 1924, if you wanted a diversified portfolio of stocks, you needed to be wealthy. Really
> wealthy. The kind of wealthy where you could afford to buy meaningful positions in dozens of
> companies while still having enough left over for a reasonable life."

### Opening Hook Patterns

1. **Historical Drama**

   > "In 2012, a software deployment error caused Knight Capital to execute $7 billion in errant
   > trades in 45 minutes. The 17-year-old firm lost $440 million and was sold within a week."

2. **Personal Connection**

   > "Then something remarkable happened in Boston..."

3. **Provocative Statement**

   > "The best investment strategy fits on an index card. The financial industry exists largely to
   > convince you otherwise."

4. **Concrete Numbers**
   > "A century later, packaged products—mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and their cousins—hold over $30
   > trillion in assets."

---

## 6. The "Why" Behind Everything

### Regulations as Monuments

> "Regulations are monuments to past failures."

Every rule in finance exists because:

- Someone got burned
- Someone cheated
- Something went catastrophically wrong

### Connect Facts to Consequences

**Instead of:** "Regulation T requires 50% initial margin"

**Do:** "In 1929, investors bought stocks with just 10% down. When prices fell, margin calls
cascaded, accelerating the crash. That's why Regulation T now requires 50%."

This approach makes content:

- 22x more memorable (per Stanford research)
- More engaging
- Easier to retain for exams

---

## 7. Quality Tests

Every piece of content should pass these tests:

### The Dinner Party Test

> "Would this sound normal in conversation?"

If it sounds like a textbook, rewrite it.

### The Intelligence Test

> "Does it assume smart readers?"

Don't over-explain. Assume readers can connect dots.

### The Value Test

> "Did the reader learn something?"

Every paragraph should add value.

### The Sincerity Test

> "Is this genuinely helpful?"

No filler. No padding. Only useful content.

---

## 11. Example Passages

### About Section Style

> "I started Franklin Hugh Money in 2024 to document my journey from financial confusion to
> (hopefully) financial independence. The name comes from Benjamin Franklin, whose writings on
> wealth remain surprisingly relevant, and Hugh, a family name that conveniently completes the
> acronym.
>
> I'm not a financial advisor. I'm a technology professional who got tired of paying someone 2%
> annually to do what a computer does for 0.03%."

### Monthly Update Style

> "December 2024: Portfolio value increased 3.2% to $47,832. Contributed the usual $2,000. The only
> excitement this month was explaining index funds to my barber. He seemed more interested in
> crypto. We all find our own path to enlightenment."

### Philosophy Style

> "My investment philosophy is embarrassingly simple: buy broad market index funds, keep costs low,
> and wait. This approach has been validated by decades of academic research and requires no special
> skill, which may explain why the financial industry doesn't promote it."

### Educational Content Style

> "Management companies are actively managed portfolios of securities. A fund manager—called an
> investment adviser—makes decisions about what to buy and sell based on the fund's investment
> objective.
>
> This is the key distinction: someone is actively making decisions. Whether those decisions add
> value after fees is a debate that has launched a thousand academic papers and at least one very
> successful index fund company in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania."

---

## 13. Application to Series 7

All Series 7 content must:

1. **Use the FHM voice** - Not the SIE structural patterns for writing style
2. **Follow the 90/10 rule** - 90% substance, 10% personality
3. **Open with hooks** - Never definitions
4. **Explain the why** - Connect rules to their origins
5. **Include one humor moment** - Per section, no more
6. **Pass the quality tests** - Dinner Party, Intelligence, Value, Sincerity
7. **Sound human** - Not like a textbook

### Series 7-Specific Considerations

Series 7 is more technical than SIE. The voice should:

- Maintain warmth while handling complexity
- Break down calculations step-by-step
- Use more real-world scenarios (it's for actual registered reps)
- Acknowledge the stakes (this is someone's career)

---

## 14. Taglines (If Needed)

- "An Investment in Knowledge" (main)
- "Wealth Through Wisdom"
- "Compound Daily"
