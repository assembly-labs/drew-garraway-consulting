## Voice & Tone

### Voice (Constant)

*Voice is WHO we are. It doesn't change.*

Our voice is always:

1. **[Attribute 1]** — [What this means in practice]
   - Example: "[Sample sentence]"

2. **[Attribute 2]** — [What this means in practice]
   - Example: "[Sample sentence]"

3. **[Attribute 3]** — [What this means in practice]
   - Example: "[Sample sentence]"

Our voice is NEVER:

1. **[Anti-attribute 1]** — [What to avoid]
   - Instead of: "[Bad example]"
   - We say: "[Good example]"

2. **[Anti-attribute 2]** — [What to avoid]
   - Instead of: "[Bad example]"
   - We say: "[Good example]"

3. **[Anti-attribute 3]** — [What to avoid]
   - Instead of: "[Bad example]"
   - We say: "[Good example]"

### Tone (Varies by Context)

*Tone is HOW we express our voice. It adapts to the situation.*

| Context | Tone | Why | Example |
|---------|------|-----|---------|
| **Onboarding** | [e.g., Welcoming, encouraging] | [Users are new, may be uncertain] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Daily use** | [e.g., Efficient, friendly] | [Users know what they're doing] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Success states** | [e.g., Celebratory but brief] | [Acknowledge without over-celebrating] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Error states** | [e.g., Helpful, calm, not blaming] | [User is frustrated, needs help] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Empty states** | [e.g., Encouraging, actionable] | [Guide users to add content] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Loading states** | [e.g., Brief, informative] | [Acknowledge the wait] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Notifications** | [e.g., Clear, concise] | [Grab attention without annoyance] | "[Example copy]" |
| **Settings** | [e.g., Clear, technical-friendly] | [Users are making choices] | "[Example copy]" |

| Confirmation | [Confirming verb] | "Yes, delete" |
| Cancel | [Simple] | "Cancel" / "Never mind" |
| Navigation | [Destination] | "Go to settings" |

**Avoid:**
- Generic: "Submit", "Click here", "OK"
- Vague: "Continue", "Next"

### Form Labels & Help Text

| Element | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Label | [Pattern] | "[Example]" |
| Placeholder | [Pattern] | "[Example]" |
| Help text | [Pattern] | "[Example]" |
| Required indicator | [Pattern] | "[Example]" |

**Help text principles:**
- Only include if necessary
- Put before the input if instruction
- Put after if example or formatting

---

### Error Messages

**Format:**
```
[What happened] + [What to do]
```

**Tone:** Helpful, not blaming. Never use "invalid" or "error."

| Error Type | Pattern | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Validation | [Pattern] | "Enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)" |
| System error | [Pattern] | "We couldn't save your changes. Please try again." |
| Permission | [Pattern] | "You don't have access to this. [Contact admin]" |
| Not found | [Pattern] | "We couldn't find that page. [Go home]" |

**What to avoid:**
- "Error" / "Invalid" / "Wrong"
- Technical jargon
- Blaming the user

---

### Success Messages

**Format:**
```
[What happened] + [What's next (optional)]
```

**Tone:** Acknowledge without over-celebrating.

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Save | [Pattern] | "Changes saved" |
| Create | [Pattern] | "Session created" |
| Delete | [Pattern] | "Session deleted" |
| Submit | [Pattern] | "Request sent" |

**What to avoid:**
- Excessive enthusiasm: "Awesome! Great job!"
- Empty celebration: "Success!"

---

### Empty States

**Every empty state should:**
1. Explain why it's empty (if not obvious)
2. Show how to add content
3. Provide encouragement (without being cheesy)

**Format:**
```
[Explanation] + [Action]
```

| Context | Message | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| First use | "[Welcome message]" | "[Primary action CTA]" |
| No results | "[Explanation]" | "[Try different search / Clear filters]" |
| All done | "[Positive message]" | "[Optional next action]" |
| No permission | "[Explanation]" | "[How to get access]" |

**Examples:**

**Good:**
> "No sessions yet. Ready to log your first one?"
> [Create session]

**Bad:**
> "No data available."

---

### Loading States

**Principles:**
- Acknowledge the wait
- Show progress when possible
- Keep it brief

| Duration | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| < 1 second | No message | [Just loading indicator] |
| 1-5 seconds | Brief message | "Loading..." |
| > 5 seconds | Progress message | "Loading your data..." |
| Long operations | Detailed progress | "Importing... (43 of 100)" |

---

### Notifications

**Types and patterns:**

| Type | Tone | Pattern | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| Confirmation | Neutral | [What happened] | "Session saved" |
| Warning | Cautious | [Issue] + [Impact] | "You're offline. Changes will sync later." |
| Error | Helpful | [Issue] + [Action] | "Couldn't save. [Try again]" |
| Informational | Neutral | [Information] | "New feature available" |

---

### Confirmations

**For destructive actions:**

```
[Clear question about action]

[Consequence, if not obvious]

[Confirm CTA]  [Cancel]
```

**Example:**

> Delete "Morning session"?
>
> This can't be undone.
>
> [Delete] [Cancel]
