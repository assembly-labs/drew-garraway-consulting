## Using Personas in Design

### Decision-Making Framework

When evaluating a design decision, ask:

1. **Would [Primary Name] understand this?**
   - If no → Simplify

2. **Does this help [Primary Name] achieve their goal?**
   - If no → Question whether to include

3. **Would this confuse or frustrate [Primary Name]?**
   - If yes → Redesign

4. **Is this actually for [Anti-Persona Name]?**
   - If yes → Don't build it

### Feature Prioritization

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Must Have** | [Primary Name] cannot succeed without it |
| **Should Have** | [Primary Name] strongly benefits |
| **Could Have** | Nice for [Primary Name] or helps [Secondary Name] |
| **Won't Have** | Only relevant to [Anti-Persona Name] |

## Persona Validation

Before proceeding, validate:

- [ ] Personas are based on research, not assumptions
- [ ] Each persona is distinct (not just demographic variations)
- [ ] Anti-persona is clearly defined
- [ ] Team can answer "Would [Name] want this?" for any feature
- [ ] Personas are referenced in user stories
