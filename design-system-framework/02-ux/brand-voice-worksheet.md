- When you already have strong brand intuition

**Jump to:** [Light Workshop](#light-workshop)

### Option B: Comprehensive Workshop (45-60 minutes)
Best for:
- Products where copy is core to the experience
- Consumer-facing products
- When voice is a differentiator
- When multiple people will write content
- When you want deep brand clarity

**Jump to:** [Comprehensive Workshop](#comprehensive-workshop)

## For Claude: Facilitating This Workshop

When guiding a user through this worksheet:

1. **Ask which option they prefer** (Light or Comprehensive) before starting
2. **Go question by question** — don't overwhelm with the full list
3. **Probe deeper** when answers are vague ("Can you give me an example?")
4. **Reflect back** what you're hearing ("So it sounds like the brand is...")
5. **Note contradictions** gently ("Earlier you said X, but this suggests Y — which feels more right?")
6. **Synthesize as you go** — don't wait until the end

At the end, use the answers to populate `brand-voice-matrix.md`.
