## Kill Criteria

*What would make us stop or pivot? Define this upfront to avoid sunk cost fallacy.*

### We should STOP if:

1. **[Condition]:** [Specific, measurable trigger]
   - Example: "Less than 10% of beta users return in week 2"

2. **[Condition]:** [Specific, measurable trigger]

3. **[Condition]:** [Specific, measurable trigger]

### We should PIVOT if:

1. **[Signal]:** [What we'd observe] → **Pivot to:** [Alternative direction]

2. **[Signal]:** [What we'd observe] → **Pivot to:** [Alternative direction]

## Pre-Mortem

*Imagine the product has failed. Why did it fail?*

### It's one year from now. The product failed. What happened?

Write a brief narrative:

> [The product failed because... Users didn't... We underestimated... The market... We should have...]

### Key Failure Modes Identified:

1. [Failure mode from pre-mortem]
2. [Failure mode from pre-mortem]
3. [Failure mode from pre-mortem]

### How We'll Prevent Each:

| Failure Mode | Prevention Strategy |
|--------------|---------------------|
| [Failure 1] | [What we'll do differently] |
| [Failure 2] | [What we'll do differently] |
| [Failure 3] | [What we'll do differently] |
