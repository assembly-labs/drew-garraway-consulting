# Problem Framing

> **Status:** Template — Fill in during 01-Concept phase
>
> **Instructions:** Get to the root of the problem before jumping to solutions. A well-framed problem is half-solved. A poorly framed problem leads to building the wrong thing.

**Target User:** [From brief.md]
**Date:** [Date]

## Current State vs. Desired State

### Current State
*What is the user's reality today? Describe it without referencing your solution.*

[Describe the current situation in detail. What does the user experience? What are they doing? What tools are they using? What's their emotional state?]

### Desired State
*What should be true in the future? What does success look like for the user?*

[Describe the ideal future. What would the user be able to do? How would they feel? What would be different?]

### The Gap
*What's preventing users from getting from current to desired?*

[Identify the specific obstacles, blockers, and friction points that stand between current and desired states]

---

## Problem Statement

*Use this formula to create a precise, actionable problem statement:*

### Formula
> [User type] struggles to [action/goal] because [obstacle], which results in [negative outcome].

### Your Problem Statement
> [Write your problem statement here using the formula]

### Validation Questions
Test your problem statement:

- [ ] Is the user type specific (not "everyone")?
- [ ] Is the action/goal concrete (not vague)?
- [ ] Is the obstacle real and validated?
- [ ] Is the negative outcome meaningful to users?
- [ ] Does this exist independent of your solution?

If any box is unchecked, refine the statement.

## Problem Scope

### Core Problem
*The central problem we're solving. Everything else serves this.*

[State the core problem in one sentence]

### Adjacent Problems
*Related problems that are connected but NOT our focus.*

| Adjacent Problem | Relationship to Core | Why Out of Scope |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| [Problem 1] | [How it relates] | [Why we're not solving it] |
| [Problem 2] | [How it relates] | [Why we're not solving it] |
| [Problem 3] | [How it relates] | [Why we're not solving it] |

### Explicitly NOT Solving

*What are we intentionally excluding? Being clear about this prevents scope creep.*

- [Not this problem]
- [Not this problem]
- [Not this problem]

## Confidence Check

Before moving on, rate your confidence:

| Aspect | Confidence (1-5) | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Problem is real | [1-5] | [Why?] |
| Problem is painful enough | [1-5] | [Why?] |
| We understand root cause | [1-5] | [Why?] |
| We have enough evidence | [1-5] | [Why?] |
| Problem is solvable | [1-5] | [Why?] |

**Average confidence:** [Calculate]

If average is below 3, gather more evidence before proceeding.
