                  When Hunter was bullied in elementary school for having two prosthetic legs,

                  Hugh lost both legs in a climbing accident at 17. Instead of quitting, he started

                  <strong>"Leader of the Bionic Age."</strong> He now runs a lab at MIT
                  that invents next-generation prosthetics.

            Most Paralympic swimmers actually <strong>don't use prosthetics</strong> when racing!
            The rules don't allow them. Instead, swimmers with limb differences learn special
            techniques to move powerfully through the water using their natural abilities.

            <strong>The Paralympics started in 1960 in Rome, Italy.</strong> They happen every 4 years,
            right after the Olympic Games, in the same city and venues. The word "Para" comes from
            the Greek word meaning "beside" - the Paralympics run alongside the Olympics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Athletes are classified into different categories based on their abilities, so competition
            is fair. For example, a runner with one prosthetic leg competes against other runners
            with similar abilities, not against runners with two prosthetic legs.
