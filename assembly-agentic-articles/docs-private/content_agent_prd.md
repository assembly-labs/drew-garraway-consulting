- Manual reformatting for each platform
- Loss of momentum between idea and publication
- Inconsistent quality when rushing content

---

## Product Vision

**Compress content creation from hours to minutes** by enabling users to transform a single sentence into publication-ready, research-backed content for X, LinkedIn, and TikTok with minimal human intervention.

---
