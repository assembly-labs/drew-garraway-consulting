# LIBRARY CARDS

## Provisional Library Card and Non-Resident Library Cards

Provisional library cards can be issued to individuals who can show proof of PA residency but do not live in the library's service area. Provisional library cards are issued at no cost. Provisional library cardholders are limited to checking out three items at a time with no access to digital resources.

Individuals who cannot show proof of residency, or are visitors to the area, may purchase an annual non-resident library card. Fees for non-resident library cards are set at the discretion of each member library. An annual non-resident library card entitles the holder to full borrowing privileges.

## Borrowing Privileges and Other Services

Library cardholders in good standing are entitled to borrow materials from the system's physical collection. Access to digital resources is limited to individuals with standard library cards.

Specific loan periods and renewal information for library materials can be found on the patron's library receipt.

## Lost, Stolen, or Provisional Library Cards

Patrons are responsible for all materials borrowed with their library card(s). If a library card is lost or stolen, the patron must immediately notify the library where their account was created. A CCLS member library will place a restriction on the account to prevent its use. Only the member library where the patron's account was created can issue a replacement library card. A replacement fee may be charged.

If a patron's library account is in good standing, CCLS member libraries will issue a paper receipt with a barcode that can be used to access library resources. This receipt is valid for 30 days and cannot be used to access digital resources. A library patron can only receive two provisional cards in a 12-month period. Patrons may not use another individual's library card without their permission.

## PATRON RESPONSIBILITIES

Patrons are responsible for all materials checked out on their library card and are encouraged to keep track of due dates and renew items in a timely fashion.

The parent or legal guardian who signs a minor's library card application is responsible for all materials borrowed by the minor. See Youth Services exceptions to this rule.

A library patron is liable for charges resulting from lost or damaged materials, in accordance with the Fines and Fees policy.

## FINES AND FEES

## Overdue Fines

Overdue fines are charged when an item is returned past its due date. CCLS eliminated overdue fines on most materials starting July 1, 2021. Items that still have overdue fines include:
- Museum passes
- Library of Things materials
- ILL items from other library systems

Specific fine amounts are set by each CCLS member library.

## Miscellaneous Fees

CCLS member libraries may charge fees for various services including, but not limited to:
- Replacement library cards
- Photocopying
- Printing
- Faxing
- Proctoring exams
- Processing fees for lost or damaged items

## Fines and Fees for Unreturned, Lost or Damaged Materials

Library patrons are responsible for library materials checked out on their library card. If materials are not returned 21 days past their due date, the patron's account will be charged the replacement cost plus any applicable processing fee. Once payment is made, the item becomes the property of the patron.

If a patron pays for an item and returns it within 6 months, CCLS will refund the replacement cost but not the processing fee. The patron must provide proof of payment.

Materials that are damaged beyond use will be charged to the patron at replacement cost plus processing fee.

## Paying Library Fines and Fees

Fines and fees can be paid at any CCLS member library. Payment may be made by cash, check, or credit card depending on the policies of each member library.
