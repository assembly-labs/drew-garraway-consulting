# ✅ Migration Complete: Secure API Key Implementation

## 🎉 What We Did

Successfully migrated your Librarian LLM app from **insecure client-side API keys** to **secure serverless backend proxy**.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### New Files Created:
1. **`netlify/functions/claude-chat.js`** - Serverless function that securely calls Claude API
2. **`netlify.toml`** - Netlify configuration for deployment
3. **`DEPLOYMENT_NETLIFY.md`** - Complete deployment guide
4. **`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/hooks/useClaudeChat.ts`** - Now calls `/api/claude-chat` instead of Anthropic directly
2. **`package.json`** - Added `netlify-cli` dev dependency and `dev:netlify` script
3. **`.env`** - Changed `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY` to `claude_api_key`
4. **`.env.example`** - Updated with new variable name and documentation

### Files NOT Changed:
- `.gitignore` - Already properly configured ✅
- All other source files work without modification

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Before (Insecure ❌):
```
Browser → Anthropic API (with exposed key in JavaScript)
```
- API key embedded in bundled JavaScript
- Anyone could steal key from browser DevTools
- Key got revoked every time you deployed

### After (Secure ✅):
```
Browser → Your Netlify Function → Anthropic API
```
- API key stored securely in Netlify environment variables
- Never exposed to the browser
- No more key revocations!

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Build Test: **PASSED** ✅
```bash
npm run build
✓ 88 modules transformed
✓ built in 686ms
```

### Security Check: **PASSED** ✅
```bash
# Searched for API keys in built files
grep -r "sk-ant-api03-" dist/
# Result: Only found in error message text (harmless)
# No actual API key in bundle! ✅
```

## 📋 Next Steps for YOU

### 1. Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/drewgarraway/Documents/GitHub/drew-garraway-consulting/librarian-llm

# Start Netlify dev server
npm run dev:netlify

# Open http://localhost:8888
# Try searching for books - should work!
```

### 2. Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/drewgarraway/Documents/GitHub/drew-garraway-consulting

# Review changes
git status
git diff

# Commit and push
git add librarian-llm/
git commit -m "Secure deployment: Move API key to Netlify Functions backend"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Netlify (10 minutes)

Follow the detailed guide in **`DEPLOYMENT_NETLIFY.md`**

Quick summary:
1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to your GitHub repo: `assembly-labs/drew-garraway-consulting`
4. Configure:
   - Base directory: `librarian-llm`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `librarian-llm/dist`
5. **IMPORTANT:** Add environment variable:
   - Key: `claude_api_key`
   - Value: Your actual API key
6. Click "Deploy site"

### 4. Test Production (5 minutes)

After deployment:
1. Open your Netlify URL
2. Try searching for books
3. Open DevTools → Network tab → verify calls go to `/api/claude-chat`
4. Open DevTools → Sources → search for your API key → should find NOTHING!

## 🎓 How It Works

### Local Development:
```
npm run dev:netlify
→ Starts Vite + Netlify Functions locally
→ Reads claude_api_key from your .env file
→ Functions run at http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/claude-chat
→ Frontend calls /api/claude-chat which redirects to function
```

### Production:
```
Browser makes request to: /api/claude-chat
→ Netlify redirects to: /.netlify/functions/claude-chat
→ Function reads claude_api_key from Netlify environment
→ Function calls Anthropic API
→ Function returns response to browser
→ API key never leaves the server! ✅
```

## 💡 Key Technical Details

### Environment Variables:
- **Before:** `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY` (bundled into JavaScript - BAD ❌)
- **After:** `claude_api_key` (only on server - GOOD ✅)

### API Call Flow:
```typescript
// OLD CODE (removed):
const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY,
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true // This was the problem!
});

// NEW CODE (current):
const response = await fetch('/api/claude-chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ messages, systemPrompt })
});
```

### Netlify Function:
```javascript
// netlify/functions/claude-chat.js
const apiKey = process.env.claude_api_key; // Secure! Only on server
const client = new Anthropic({ apiKey });
// ... make API call and return response
```

## 📊 Project Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Security Architecture | ✅ Complete | API key now server-side only |
| Code Changes | ✅ Complete | All files updated |
| Local Testing | ✅ Verified | Build succeeds, no key in bundle |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive deployment guide |
| Deployment | ⏳ **Your Turn** | Follow DEPLOYMENT_NETLIFY.md |

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Don't Forget:
- ✅ The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` - your key won't be committed
- ✅ Use `claude_api_key` (NOT `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY`) going forward
- ✅ Set the environment variable in Netlify Dashboard before deploying
- ✅ Test locally with `npm run dev:netlify` before deploying

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Regular local dev (React only, API calls will fail):
npm run dev

# Netlify local dev (React + Functions, full app works):
npm run dev:netlify

# Build for production:
npm run build

# Type checking:
npm run lint
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know everything works when:
1. ✅ Local dev server works (`npm run dev:netlify`)
2. ✅ Book search returns results
3. ✅ Deployed site works on Netlify
4. ✅ No API key visible in browser source code
5. ✅ Network requests go to `/api/claude-chat`
6. ✅ No more API key revocations from Anthropic!

## 💬 Questions?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `DEPLOYMENT_NETLIFY.md` for troubleshooting
2. Look at Netlify Function logs in dashboard
3. Verify environment variable is set correctly
4. Make sure you're using `npm run dev:netlify` for local testing
