# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - NETLIFY ONLY

## Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: Librarian LLM with dark mode and secure API"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Netlify Auto-Deploy:
- Already connected to your GitHub repo
- Will automatically build and deploy when you push
- Watch the deploy progress at: https://app.netlify.com

### 3. Verify Deployment:
- Check your Netlify URL (e.g., https://librarian-llm.netlify.app)
- Test search functionality (should connect to Claude API)
- Test dark mode toggle (should persist on refresh)
- Verify API calls go through `/api/claude-chat` (check Network tab)

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

To use `drewgarraway.com/librarian-llm`:

### Option A: Subdomain (Recommended)
1. Create subdomain: `librarian.drewgarraway.com`
2. Add CNAME record pointing to `[your-site].netlify.app`
3. Configure in Netlify: Site Settings â†’ Domain Management

### Option B: Path-based Routing
1. Use Netlify's redirect rules
2. More complex - requires proxy configuration
3. Subdomain approach is simpler and cleaner

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Netlify build logs for errors
2. Verify `claude_api_key` environment variable is set
3. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
4. Check that functions directory path is correct

### If API calls fail:
1. Verify environment variable name is `claude_api_key` (lowercase)
2. Check that API key is valid and not revoked
3. Look at Function logs in Netlify dashboard
4. Test locally with `npm run dev:netlify`
