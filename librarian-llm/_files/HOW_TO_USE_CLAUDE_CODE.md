# How to Use This Implementation Brief with Claude Code

## Overview
This brief guides Claude Code (the agentic coding tool) through analyzing your Librarian LLM codebase and recommending RAG optimizations to minimize token usage while maximizing search relevance.

## Prerequisites
1. Have Claude Code available (command-line tool)
2. Your Librarian LLM prototype codebase (or PRD documents if code doesn't exist yet)
3. catalog.json file with mock library data

## Steps to Execute

### Step 1: Open Claude Code
```bash
# In your terminal, navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/librarian-llm-project

# Launch Claude Code
claude-code
```

### Step 2: Provide the Implementation Brief

Copy and paste this into Claude Code:

```
I need you to analyze my Librarian LLM codebase and optimize the RAG architecture.

Please follow this implementation brief exactly:
[Paste the entire contents of claude_code_implementation_brief.md here]

Start with Phase 1: Codebase Discovery & Analysis.
```

### Step 3: Let Claude Code Work

Claude Code will:
1. Explore your codebase structure
2. Analyze catalog.json
3. Review any existing RAG implementation
4. Run token usage analysis
5. Generate optimization recommendations
6. Create implementation templates
7. Provide a comprehensive report

**Expected Duration:** 60-90 minutes for complete analysis

### Step 4: Review Outputs

Claude Code will create files in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`:

- `rag_optimization_report.md` - Full findings and recommendations
- `implementation_checklist.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide
- `token_analysis.ts` - Script to measure token usage
- `optimization_templates/` - Starter code templates

### Step 5: Ask Follow-Up Questions

After Claude Code completes the analysis, you can ask:

- "Which optimization should I implement first?"
- "Show me the complete code for the semantic search implementation"
- "How do I measure if the optimization is working?"
- "What's the expected timeline for implementing all optimizations?"

## What Claude Code Will Discover

### If Your Code Exists:
- Current RAG implementation patterns
- Exact token usage per query
- Bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Specific code files that need changes

### If Only PRDs Exist:
- Recommended architecture based on PRD specifications
- Proactive optimization strategies
- Implementation templates to start from
- Token usage projections

## Expected Outcomes

You'll receive:

✅ **Concrete token reduction strategies** (targeting 85-99% savings)
✅ **Prioritized implementation roadmap** (with effort/impact analysis)
✅ **Working code examples** (ready to integrate)
✅ **Before/after measurements** (proving the optimization works)

## Troubleshooting

**If Claude Code can't find your code:**
- It will analyze catalog.json structure
- Recommend architecture based on PRDs
- Provide implementation templates to start from

**If Claude Code gets stuck:**
- Ask it to "continue with Phase 2"
- Or ask it to "summarize what you've found so far"

**If you want more detail on a specific optimization:**
- Ask: "Explain optimization #2 in more depth"
- Or: "Show me the complete implementation for semantic search"

## Quick Start (If You're Impatient)

Just paste this into Claude Code:

```
Analyze my Librarian LLM prototype and tell me:
1. How many tokens am I currently using per query?
2. What are the top 3 ways to reduce token usage?
3. Which optimization should I implement first?

Use the implementation brief at /mnt/user-data/outputs/claude_code_implementation_brief.md as your guide.
```

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. **Review the recommendations** - Understand the trade-offs
2. **Choose your approach** - Start with high-impact, low-effort wins
3. **Implement Phase 1** - Two-tier data architecture (easiest)
4. **Measure improvements** - Run before/after token counts
5. **Iterate** - Add semantic search, then context management

**Questions?** Ask Claude (me, not Claude Code) for clarification on any part of this process.
