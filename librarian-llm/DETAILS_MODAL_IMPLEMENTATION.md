## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
1. `src/components/modals/ItemDetailsModal.tsx` - The modal component
2. `scripts/add_details_batch1.py` - Script to add details to first 10 items

**Modified:**
1. `src/types/index.ts` - Added `BookDetails`, `ThingDetails`, and `details` field
2. `src/App.tsx` - Wired up the modal with state management
3. `data/catalog.json` - Added rich details to first 10 items

### Type Definitions

```typescript
// For books
interface BookDetails {
  extendedDescription?: string;
  awards?: string[];
  reviews?: { reviewer: string; quote: string; rating?: number }[];
  authorBio?: string;
  funFacts?: string[];
  similarTitles?: string[];
  targetAudience?: string;
  contentWarnings?: string[];
}

// For Library of Things
interface ThingDetails {
  whatsIncluded?: string[];
  howToUse?: string;
  careInstructions?: string;
  safetyInfo?: string;
  recommendedUses?: string[];
  phillyTips?: string[];  // ‚Üê Philadelphia-specific!
  bestSeasons?: string[];
  ageRecommendation?: string;
  depositAmount?: number;
  replacementCost?: number;
}
```

### How It Works

1. **User clicks "View Details"** on any item card
2. **App.tsx** sets `selectedItem` state to the clicked item
3. **ItemDetailsModal** opens with the item data
4. **Modal detects** whether it's a book or LoT item (`itemType`)
5. **Renders appropriate layout** with all available details
6. **User can close** with X button, Escape key, or clicking overlay
7. **User can place hold** directly from the modal

## üìù How to Add More Details (Batches 2-12)

### Option A: Use the Pattern from Batch 1

Create similar Python scripts for each batch:

```bash
# Batch 2: Next 10 items
python scripts/add_details_batch2.py

# Batch 3: Next 10 items
python scripts/add_details_batch3.py

# ... and so on
```

### Option B: Manual JSON Editing

Add a `details` object to any catalog item:

```json
{
  "id": "book_006",
  "title": "The Guest List",
  ...
  "details": {
    "extendedDescription": "...",
    "authorBio": "...",
    "awards": [...],
    "reviews": [...],
    "funFacts": [...]
  }
}
```

### Option C: AI-Assisted Batch Creation

Use Claude or another LLM to generate rich details for batches of 10 items. Example prompt:

```
I need rich, detailed information for these 10 library items:
[paste item titles and basic info]

For each item, provide:
- Extended description (200-300 words)
- Author bio (100-150 words)
- 3-5 awards or accolades
- 2-3 professional reviews with quotes
- 4-6 fun facts
- Target audience description
- 3-5 similar titles

Format as JSON matching this structure:
{details: {...}}
```
