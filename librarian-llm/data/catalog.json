But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the '80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love.",

      "extendedDescription": "The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern Black community and running away at age 16, it's not just their looks that are different. It's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Ten years later, one sister lives with her Black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. This is a stunning exploration of identity, family, and the way history shapes us.",

Her twin brother, Hamnet, searches for help while their mother, Agnes (known to history as Anne Hathaway), is away. By the time Agnes returns, it is too late. Her son Hamnet is dead. Four years later, her husband William Shakespeare writes his greatest play: Hamlet. This is the story of that loss, of a marriage, of a family in Elizabethan England, and of how grief can transform us. It's also a stunning reimagining of Agnes Hathaway—not as a footnote in Shakespeare's story, but as a force in her own right.",

When she discovers she possesses the power of witchcraft, she is exiled to the deserted island of Aiaia. There, she hones her craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of mythology's most famous figures: the messenger god Hermes, the craftsman Daedalus, the hero Odysseus. But there is danger in solitude, and Circe must choose between the gods and the mortals she has come to love. This is a stunning reimagining of one of mythology's most infamous women.",

As the hours pass and it becomes clear that the robber is not a criminal mastermind (they forgot to bring bullets), the hostages begin to talk. What emerges are stories of divorce, job loss, anxiety, and the universal human need to be seen and understood. This is vintage Fredrik Backman: funny, heartbreaking, and filled with wisdom about what it means to be human.",

Together, they create a wildly successful video game called Ichigo. Their collaboration turns into a business partnership that launches them to fame, but as the stakes rise, so do the tensions between them. This is a love story, but not a romantic one—it's about the love between creative partners, the kind that can be as consuming and complicated as any romance. It's about the worlds we create, the worlds we escape to, and the impossibility of understanding another person completely.",

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her 'head-for-the-hills bag.' Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when Tara's older brother became violent. Then, lacking any formal schooling, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her to Harvard and to Cambridge University for her PhD. This is an unforgettable memoir about the struggle for self-invention.",

How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. This is a provocative look at who we are and where we're going.",

Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned, and it was clear that the murders were part of a sinister conspiracy to steal their oil money. As the death toll rose, the newly formed FBI took on the case. It was one of the organization's first major homicide investigations. But the bureau was then corrupt and it struggled to solve the case. This is a gripping true story of greed, murder, and racial injustice, and the birth of the FBI.",

      "extendedDescription": "For many years, Glennon Doyle denied her own desires and told herself to be satisfied with what she had. Then, at a conference for her non-profit, she locked eyes with Abby Wambach, the legendary soccer player. In that moment, her carefully built life exploded. Untamed is the story of how Glennon set herself free—first from her addiction to drugs and alcohol, then from the societal expectations that kept her caged. She stopped pleasing and started living. She found that the 'good girl' she'd been trained to be was actually a cage. Untamed shows us how to be brave, to trust ourselves, to stop betraying ourselves, and to become the women we were meant to be. It's a rallying cry for women to free themselves and live authentically.",

In Think Again, Adam Grant makes a compelling case for why we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. We live in a rapidly changing world, and the ability to question our opinions and open our minds to new perspectives is more important than ever. Grant identifies the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life. This is a book about the benefit of doubt, and about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong.",

But it also raises profound ethical questions: Should we edit our children's genes? Where do we draw the line?

      "extendedDescription": "In April 1992, Christopher McCandless walked into the Alaskan wilderness with little food and equipment, hoping to live off the land. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by moose hunters in an abandoned bus. McCandless had starved to death. Into the Wild is Jon Krakauer's haunting investigation into what drove this idealistic young man to abandon everything—family, money, future—to pursue his dream of living in the wild. Drawing on McCandless's journals and interviews with those who knew him, Krakauer creates a portrait of a searcher torn between the comfort of society and the call of the wild. This is a story about the allure and danger of the untamed, and about a young man's tragic quest for transcendence.",
