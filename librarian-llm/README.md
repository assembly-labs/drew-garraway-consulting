## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ (you have v24.9.0 ✅)
- Claude API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **Note:** Currently configured to use Claude 3 Haiku (March 2024) - a fast, efficient model perfect for prototyping

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up your Claude API key:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit .env and add your Claude API key
   # claude_api_key=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing Checklist

- [ ] Search for books using natural language
- [ ] Test follow-up questions
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Verify error handling

### Demo Scenarios

1. **First-time user**: "I just finished Educated and loved it"
2. **Format preference**: "Do you have that in audiobook?"
3. **Equipment inquiry**: "Can I borrow a 3D printer?"
4. **Media request**: "Nature documentaries on DVD"
5. **Complex request**: "Activities for a rainy day with kids"
6. **Library of Things**: "Do you have tools I can borrow?"

## 🤝 For Pilot Libraries

This is a **prototype demonstration**, not production software. It:
- ✅ Shows conversational search for all library materials
- ✅ Demonstrates "Library of Things" capabilities
- ✅ Uses real AI (Claude) for recommendations
- ✅ Supports diverse materials (books, DVDs, games, equipment, etc.)
- ✅ Works on mobile and desktop
- ❌ Does NOT connect to real library systems
- ❌ Does NOT scale beyond demo usage

For production implementation timeline and costs, please contact the development team.
