**Project:** Championship Athletic Prospects
**Started:** 2024-10-20

---

## Session #4 - 2024-10-20 15:00
**Duration:** 3 hours
**Focus:** Methodology Alignment & Progress Tracking

### ✅ Completed
1. **Design System Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive design-system.css with CAP branding
   - Updated Tailwind configuration with new fonts and colors
   - Created Typography component with all variants
   - Updated Button and Card components with new variants
   - Applied design system to home page and auth pages
   - Created design-system test page at `/design-system`

2. **Discovered Existing Work**
   - Found existing Netlify configuration
   - Found database migrations already created
   - Found cap-config.ts with full configuration
   - Found two auth functions already implemented

3. **Created Documentation System**
   - UNIFIED_METHODOLOGY.md - Single source of truth
   - CAP_DEVELOPMENT_TRACKER.md - Progress tracking
   - USER_ACTION_ITEMS.md - Clear user tasks
   - DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - This session log

### 🚧 Identified Blockers
- Supabase credentials not in .env.local
- Netlify deployment not connected
- Claude API key needed for bio generation
- Stripe keys needed for checkout

### 💡 Key Decisions
- Build on existing foundation, don't recreate
- Follow established patterns from existing code
- Use Claude API only (removed Replicate for cost)
- Implement manual photo editing for MVP (no AI background removal)

### 📝 Notes
- Database schema is well-designed and complete
- Auth functions follow good patterns
- Design system is fully integrated
- About 35% of MVP is complete
