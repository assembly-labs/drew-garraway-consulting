# Getting Started with CAP Development

**Welcome to CAP (Championship Athletic Prospects)!** This guide helps you get started building the platform.

## 📚 What We've Set Up For You

### 1. **Master Implementation Guide**
   - **File:** `/docs/CAP_MASTER_GUIDE.md`
   - **Purpose:** Your complete reference for building CAP
   - **Contains:**
     - Project context and tech stack
     - Detailed folder structure explanation
     - 8-week build roadmap with phases
     - Code patterns to copy-paste
     - Architecture decisions (why we chose what)
     - Quick reference cheatsheet

### 2. **Project README**
   - **File:** `/README.md` (root)
   - **Purpose:** Quick context for you and AI assistants
   - **Bot reads this automatically** when scanning project

### 3. **Environment Template**
   - **File:** `.env.example`
   - **Purpose:** Template for all API keys and secrets
   - **Next step:** Copy to `.env.local` and fill in real values

### 4. **Git Configuration**
   - **File:** `.gitignore`
   - **Purpose:** Prevents committing secrets and build files
   - **Protects:** `.env.local`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, etc.

## 🎯 How to Work with AI Assistants

### Every New Chat Session:

The AI assistant will automatically:
1. ✅ Scan your codebase
2. ✅ Read `/README.md`
3. ✅ Reference `/docs/CAP_MASTER_GUIDE.md`
4. ✅ Start with a context summary:

```
📋 CAP Project Context:
- Current Phase: [X]
- Last Completed: [Y]
- Working On: [Z]
```

### You Don't Need to Remember Anything!

Just say things like:
- "Let's continue building CAP"
- "Start working on Phase 1"
- "Help me set up authentication"

The bot will know what to do because of the master guide.

## 🚀 Next Steps: Initializing the Project

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Make sure you're in the CAP directory
cd /Users/drewgarraway/Documents/GitHub/drew-garraway-consulting/CAP

# Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init

# Create initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial CAP project structure and documentation"
```

### Step 2: Create Accounts for Services

Before we can code, you need accounts for:

1. **Supabase** (https://supabase.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Save your project URL and anon key

2. **Netlify** (https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Add New Site"
   - Connect your GitHub repo (after pushing)

3. **Stripe** (https://stripe.com)
   - Sign up for account
   - Get test mode API keys

4. **Replicate** (https://replicate.com)
   - Sign up for account
   - Get API token

5. **Anthropic** (https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Sign up for Claude API access
   - Get API key

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your actual keys
# (Use your preferred text editor)
```

### Step 4: Tell the AI to Start Building!

Once you have:
- ✅ Accounts created
- ✅ `.env.local` filled in
- ✅ Git initialized

Simply say to the AI:

> "I've set up my accounts and environment variables. Let's start Phase 1: Foundation. Begin by initializing the Next.js project."

The bot will reference the master guide and start building!

## 🎯 Your Workflow

1. **Start a new feature:**
   - Check master guide for the phase you're in
   - Review code patterns for that feature type
   - Tell AI: "Let's build [feature name] from Phase [X]"

2. **AI builds the feature:**
   - Following patterns from master guide
   - Using correct folder structure
   - Applying CAP branding

3. **Test and iterate:**
   - Test the feature
   - Ask for adjustments if needed

4. **Update progress:**
   - AI updates BUILD_STATUS in master guide
   - Move on to next feature

---

## ✅ Ready to Start?

You're all set! Here's what to do next:

1. **Read through `/docs/CAP_MASTER_GUIDE.md`** (at least Part 1 and 2)
2. **Set up your accounts** (Supabase, Netlify, etc.)
3. **Fill in `.env.local`** with your API keys
4. **Tell the AI:** "Let's start building Phase 1"

The master guide has everything you need. The AI will reference it automatically. You're ready to build something awesome! 🏆
