# Motion Glossary Progress

## Last Session: Dec 25, 2024

### Completed
- **Editing Booth UX** - New unified animation editing experience with controls, preview, and live code
- **Registry System** - 30 animations registered with metadata, controls, and code templates
- **Animation Gallery** - Visual grid with search and category filtering
- **Particle Effects** - 3 new canvas-based effects:
  - FloatingParticles (drifting dust motes)
  - Starfield (twinkling stars with parallax)
  - ParticleNetwork (connected constellation)

### Where to Pick Up
1. Test particle effects in Storybook (Editing Booth/Particle Effects)
2. Polish Editing Booth styling and responsiveness
3. Add more particle effects if desired

### Future Work
- Photography Glossary (stock photo database for backgrounds - separate feature)

cd motion-glossary && npm run storybook
```
