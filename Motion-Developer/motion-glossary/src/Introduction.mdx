## What is This?

Motion Glossary is a visual glossary of motion patterns organized by use case. It's designed to be:

- **Browsable** - Navigate animations by category
- **Interactive** - See each animation running live with adjustable parameters
- **Copy-Paste Ready** - View and copy the code for any animation
- **Educational** - Understand when and why to use each pattern
- **Accessible** - All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Categories

### 1. Entrances & Exits
Bringing elements into view and removing them gracefully. Includes fades, slides, scales, reveals, and specialty entrances.

### 2. Attention & Emphasis
Drawing the user's eye to important elements. Includes pulses, shakes, bounces, glows, and highlights.

### 3. Feedback & State
Communicating system status and response to user actions. Includes button effects, loading states, success/error animations, and toggles.

### 4. Navigation & Flow
Guiding users through the interface and between views. Includes page transitions, tabs, accordions, modals, and navigation elements.

### 5. Scroll-Driven
Animations tied to scroll position and viewport entry. Includes reveal effects, parallax, progress indicators, and scroll transforms.

### 6. Text & Typography
Bringing text to life. Includes typewriter effects, character reveals, text effects, counters, and specialized text animations.

### 7. Decorative & Ambient
Adding visual polish and delight. Includes floating elements, cursor effects, particles, SVG animations, and card effects.

### 8. Micro-Interactions
Small, delightful feedback for user actions. Includes icon animations, likes, notifications, and interactive elements.

### 9. Ambient Backgrounds
Subtle motion that gives pages life without distracting from content. Includes gradients, particles, waves, and atmospheric effects.

## Tech Stack

- **React 18+** - Functional components with hooks
- **Framer Motion** - Physics-based animations
- **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety

## Getting Started

Each animation component can be used directly in your React projects:

```tsx
import { FadeIn } from 'motion-glossary/animations';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <FadeIn duration={0.5} delay={0.1}>
      <div>Your content here</div>
    </FadeIn>
  );
}
```

## Using the Library

1. **Browse** - Use the sidebar to explore animations by category
2. **Preview** - Watch the animation in the preview panel
3. **Adjust** - Use controls to tweak duration, easing, and other parameters
4. **Copy** - Click the copy button to grab the code
5. **Implement** - Paste into your project and customize

## New to Animation? Start Here!

**Check out the "Controls Guide" page** in the sidebar. It explains every setting in plain English:
- What each control does
- What values to use
- What happens when you change them
- Recommended starting points for common use cases

Perfect for developers who want to understand animation settings without diving into documentation.

## Accessibility

All animations in this library respect the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` preference. When reduced motion is enabled:

- Opacity-only animations replace transform-based ones
- Durations are minimized
- Repeated/infinite animations are disabled
