If you're thinking about becoming a farmers market vendor, here's what I wish someone had told me on day one:

**Start smaller than you think.** My first market, I made 200 jars of jam. I sold 23. I ate a lot of toast that month.

**Talk to your neighbors.** The vendors on either side of you have seen it all. They'll tell you which markets are worth the drive, when to expect slow days, and why you should always bring more ones than you think you need.

**Weather happens.** I've sold jam in 95-degree heat and near-freezing rain. The regulars show up regardless. Have a plan for both extremes.

**Your table is your storefront.** I thought I could just put out jars. Wrong. A good display, clear pricing, and samples make all the difference.

**It's a marathon, not a sprint.** My first months were brutal. Now, a year in, I have regulars who ask about my life. That takes time.

Would I do it again? Absolutely. But I'd do it with more realistic expectations and fewer jars of inventory.
