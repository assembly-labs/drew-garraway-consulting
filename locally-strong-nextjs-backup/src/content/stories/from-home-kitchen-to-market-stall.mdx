My grandmother made the best empanadas I've ever tasted. When she passed, I inherited her recipes—handwritten on yellowed index cards in a mix of Spanish and English.

For years, I made them only for family gatherings. Friends would beg for the recipe. Coworkers offered to pay me for a dozen. But starting a food business seemed impossibly complicated.

Then I attended a Locally Strong workshop on cottage food laws. I learned that Pennsylvania allows home-based food businesses for many products. The workshop leader connected me with a mentor—another market vendor who had started the same way.

My mentor walked me through everything: licensing, pricing, insurance, market applications. She even let me shadow her at her stall to learn the rhythm of market days.

This spring marks my second year at the Wayne Farmers Market. I sell out most Saturdays. I've hired my niece to help. And every time a customer tells me my empanadas remind them of their own grandmother's cooking, I feel like I'm keeping something precious alive.
