When I moved to the Main Line for a new job, I didn't know a single person. My apartment felt temporary. The suburban sprawl felt isolating after years of city living.

On a random Saturday, I wandered into the Wayne Farmers Market mostly out of boredom. I left three hours later with a bag of peaches, a jar of local honey, and conversations with four different vendors.

I started going every week. The vegetable vendor learned my name. The bread baker saved me a loaf of sourdough. The flower farmer started recommending arrangements for my bare apartment.

Within months, I wasn't just a customer—I was a regular. When I mentioned I worked in marketing, the Locally Strong team asked if I could help with their newsletter. Now I volunteer at events and have friends who feel more like family.

That first Saturday at the market, I was looking for groceries. I found something much more valuable: a place where I belonged.
