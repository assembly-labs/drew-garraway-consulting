I'm a family medicine doctor. I spend my days telling patients to eat more vegetables. I was also, embarrassingly, terrible at following my own advice.

Two years ago, a new neighbor invited me to the farmers market. I went to be polite and left with armfuls of produce I didn't know how to cook.

The vendor who sold me rainbow chard took pity on me. She wrote down a simple recipe on the back of her business card. The next week, she asked how it turned out. The week after that, she had another suggestion.

Something shifted. When I knew the person who grew my food, I felt accountable to actually use it. The market became a weekly ritual. I learned what was in season. I discovered vegetables I'd never tried.

Within six months, my own labs improved. More energy. Better sleep. The bloodwork numbers that had been creeping in the wrong direction started moving the right way.

I still write prescriptions. But now I also write down farmers market recommendations. Food might not be medicine, but it's closer than I ever realized.
