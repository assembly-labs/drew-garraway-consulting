When my parents immigrated from Taiwan in the 1980s, they brought with them seeds—both literal and metaphorical. The literal seeds became a small backyard garden. The metaphorical ones? A deep belief in community and hard work.

In 2015, I convinced my reluctant father to set up a table at the Wayne Farmers Market. "Who will buy our vegetables?" he asked. "Everyone has a supermarket."

That first Saturday, we sold out of bok choy in two hours. A customer asked if we could grow yu choy. Another wanted to know about our family recipes. By the end of the day, we had a waiting list.

Ten years later, Chen Family Farms supplies three farmers markets and two local restaurants. My parents, now in their seventies, still tend the original garden. My children help at the market stand on Saturdays.

The farmers market didn't just transform our business—it transformed our family. We found a community that valued what we grew and the stories behind it.
