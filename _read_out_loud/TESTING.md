## Testing Process

### Step 1: Start HTTPS Development Server

```bash

python3 server_https.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸš€ Text Reader App - HTTPS Development Server
ðŸ“± LOCAL ACCESS: https://localhost:8443
ðŸ“± iOS DEVICE ACCESS: https://192.168.1.XXX:8443
```

### Step 4: Test on iOS Device

#### 4.1 Connect to Server

1. **Find your laptop's IP:**
   ```bash
   # The server will display it, or run:
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Open on iPhone/iPad:**
   ```
   https://192.168.1.XXX:8443
   ```

3. **Accept Security Warning:**
   - Tap "Advanced" or "Details"
   - Tap "Proceed to 192.168.1.XXX (unsafe)" or "Visit this website"
   - This is normal for self-signed certificates in development

#### 4.2 iOS-Specific Tests

##### File Import (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Tap "Import File"
- [ ] Should see file picker (Files app)
- [ ] Select PDF from iCloud Drive â†’ Should import
- [ ] Select DOCX from Files â†’ Should import
- [ ] Select TXT file â†’ Should import

**Common Issues:**
- **File picker doesn't open:** Check HTTPS is working (lock icon in Safari)
- **Files don't load:** Check browser console for errors
- **PDF/DOCX fails:** Check internet connection (CDN libraries needed)

##### Text-to-Speech on iOS
- [ ] Paste text
- [ ] Click Play
- [ ] Verify iOS voice plays (may differ from desktop)
- [ ] Test with iPhone locked (may pause)
- [ ] Test with headphones

##### PWA Installation
- [ ] Tap Share button (center bottom in Safari)
- [ ] Scroll down â†’ Tap "Add to Home Screen"
- [ ] Edit name if desired â†’ Tap "Add"
- [ ] Verify icon appears on home screen
- [ ] Launch from home screen
- [ ] Should open fullscreen (no Safari UI)

##### Library & Storage
- [ ] Save text to library
- [ ] Close app completely
- [ ] Reopen from home screen
- [ ] Check library persists (localStorage)

##### Offline Mode
- [ ] Use app with WiFi ON
- [ ] Turn on Airplane mode
- [ ] Launch app from home screen
- [ ] Should still work (basic features)
- [ ] File import will fail (no CDN access)

### Step 5: Cross-Browser Testing

Test on multiple browsers/devices:

| Browser | Platform | Priority | Tests |
|---------|----------|----------|-------|
| Safari | iOS | ðŸ”´ High | File import, PWA, TTS |
| Chrome | iOS | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Basic functionality |
| Safari | macOS | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Desktop features |
| Chrome | Desktop | ðŸŸ¢ Low | Compatibility |

## Troubleshooting

### SSL Certificate Issues

**Problem:** Browser shows "Not Secure" or blocks page

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall mkcert
mkcert -uninstall
mkcert -install

# Regenerate certificates
rm localhost.pem localhost-key.pem
python3 server_https.py
```

### iOS File Import Not Working

**Problem:** File picker doesn't open or files don't load

**Checklist:**
1. âœ“ Using HTTPS (not HTTP)
2. âœ“ Accepted security warning on iOS
3. âœ“ Internet connection active (for CDN libraries)
4. âœ“ File size under 10MB
5. âœ“ Supported file type (.txt, .pdf, .docx)

**Debug:**
1. Open Safari Developer Tools on Mac:
   - Safari â†’ Develop â†’ [Your iPhone] â†’ [Page name]
2. Check Console for errors
3. Look for FileReader or library loading errors

---

### PWA Not Installing

**Problem:** "Add to Home Screen" doesn't show PWA option

**Requirements:**
- âœ“ HTTPS connection
- âœ“ Valid `manifest.json`
- âœ“ Icons accessible (192x192, 512x512)
- âœ“ Opened in Safari (not Chrome on iOS)

---

### Audio Not Playing on iOS

**Problem:** Text-to-speech doesn't work

**Possible causes:**
1. Silent mode enabled (check side switch)
2. No iOS voices installed (Settings â†’ Accessibility â†’ Spoken Content)
3. Browser tab backgrounded (iOS pauses audio)
4. Autoplay blocked (requires user interaction first)

3. HTTPS status (lock icon visible?)
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Console errors (if any)
6. Expected vs actual behavior
